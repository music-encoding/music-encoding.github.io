The webpage for the Music Encoding Conference 2022 has been launched at <a href="http://music-encoding.org/conference/2022">www.music-encoding.org/conference/2022</a>.

MEC 2022 will take place Thursday 19th – Sunday 22nd May, 2022, at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada. As in the previous two years, this year’s Conference will again allow remote attendance where travel plans are affected by the ongoing pandemic. However, we look forward to welcoming as many of you in person as possible!

A Call for Contributions will be circulated soon. In the meantime, please keep an eye on the conference website for further details as they become available.
