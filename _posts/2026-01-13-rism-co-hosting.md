In Spring 2025, the RISM Digital Center submitted a proposal to the MEI Board to co-host MEI together with the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz. The proposal offered support for administrative tasks and financial management. It was discussed by both the MEI Board and the Akademie in Mainz and received a positive evaluation. It was agreed that the arrangement would take effect in January 2026. The MEI Board looks forward to benefiting from the additional support provided by the RISM Digital Center and to this strengthening of the MEI community.
