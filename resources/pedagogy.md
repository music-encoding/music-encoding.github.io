## Community-Created Pedagogy & Praxis Resources

A community knowledge-base encourages participation. MEI practitioners and instructors regularly create documentation and resources for use in teaching music encoding as part of a course, research project, or scholarly endeavor. These resources are invaluable to the wider MEI community as they document approaches, techniques, work-arounds, or outcomes that may be applicable beyond their local use-case. 

Resources on this page may include, but are not limited to cheat sheets, lesson plans/outcomes, tutorials, media, templates, and other resources. Content written in any language may be submitted. Please be aware that the content will be presented as it was received from the contributors. It will not be peer-reviewed for accuracy or efficacy. 

We will upload your resource(s) to the [Music Encoding Initiative Humanities Commons (HC) Repository](https://hcommons.org/groups/music-encoding-initiative/) along with descriptive metadata to ensure discoverability. Each resource will be assigned tags to enable filtering and easier searching. View resources under the tag: [MEI-Pedgagogy-Praxis](https://hcommons.org/deposits/?tag=mei-pedagogy-praxis). All contributions will be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike ([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)) license.

If you would like to contribute a resource that you created or collaborated on, please [complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnaXFQhtxVrt2aCaKqf0F4by_XgHHsvxhyq9-cvCDPE0j9vg/viewform) where you will need to provide descriptive metadata along with your content. Contributions can be submitted on a rolling basis and you will be notified once your content is added to the repository.

If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to the [Pedagogy Interest Group Administrative Co-Chairs](https://music-encoding.org/community/interest-groups.html), Anna Kijas and Joy H. Calico.
