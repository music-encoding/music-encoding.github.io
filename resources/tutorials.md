# MEI Tutorials

On this page, you'll find a number of small tutorials for MEI, 
each of them introducing a specific feature. 

If you're about to start learning MEI, we recommend to start with the [5 minute Quickstart](/tutorials/101-quickstart) tutorial, which will let you encode a very simple melody with MEI.

If you're about to write a new MEI tutorial, we recommend to start with the [Writing tutorials](/tutorials/tutorials) tutorial, which will provide backgrounds about the necessary steps. Please also have a look at our list of missing tutorials on [Github](https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding.github.io/issues/88).
