_Syrinx_ (_La Flûte de Pan_) by Claude Debussy (1862 - 1918) is a short piece for flute solo originally composed as a theatrical interlude called La Flûte de Pan. Comparing the first edition (published posthumously in 1927), a manuscript discovered in 1991, a 1996 edition, and a 1922 _Music and Letters_ article by the first performer of _La Flûte de Pan_, [this report](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147825165.pdf#page=41) investigates the potential of digital representation and presentation of comparative editions of music using MEI.
