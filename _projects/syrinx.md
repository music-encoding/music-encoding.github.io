_Syrinx_ (_La Fl没te de Pan_) by Claude Debussy (1862 - 1918) is a short piece for flute solo originally composed as a theatrical interlude called La Fl没te de Pan. Comparing the first edition (published posthumously in 1927), a manuscript discovered in 1991, a 1996 edition, and a 1922 _Music and Letters_ article by the first performer of _La Fl没te de Pan_, [this report](https://dh2010.cch.kcl.ac.uk/academic-programme/abstracts/papers/pdf/ab-819.pdf) investigates the potential of digital representation and presentation of comparative editions of music using MEI.
