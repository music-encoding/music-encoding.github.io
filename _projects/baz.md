[Bernd Alois Zimmermann Complete Edition](https://www.zimmermann-gesamtausgabe.de/) is the first complete edition project for music after 1945 in the academy program and presents all works, writings and a selection of the composer's correspondence in historical-critical hybrid editions. The interdependence of works and multimedia piece concepts allow the concept of the complete edition to be rethought, the opportunities of digital music editions to be used and new philological methods to be developed. During the project period (2016–2040), the editions will be published as printed volumes by the publishing house Schott Music and as digital editions as part of this online presence.
