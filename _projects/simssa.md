[SIMSSA](https://simssa.ca/) targets digitized (scanned) music scores to design an industrial-digitization infrastructure, including optical music recognition (OMR), for searching, transcribing, and analyzing music document sources. To support a wide range of musical notation systems and styles, MEI is deployed as a common format for encoding all music notation output.
