    <h1>Understanding ODD</h1>
    <p>
        This is an advanced tutorial that intends to explain the internal structures of MEI. Using those structures, it is possible to restrict
        MEI to the specific requirements and perspectives of any given use case, which is generally considered as good practice. Only with such 
        a restricted (generally referred to as "customized") version of MEI, one may enforce the editorial principles of a given project, which
        helps to technically ensure data quality. Even though such validation hardly stops semantic errors (the encoding of wrong pitches, for 
        instance), it ensures that only such markup is used that the project's workflow is tailored for, and no misinterpretations can arise from
        unexpected markup.

        This tutorial will introduce the basic concepts of the ODD language, which is used to define MEI. In a second tutorial, we will introduce 
        workflows and tools that help to create individual customizations. It is highly recommended to first familiarize yourself with the 
        underlying structures in this tutorial.

        Admittedly, this is one of the most advanced topics around MEI, and it certainly takes some time to familiarize yourself with the use of ODD. 
        However, the wide MEI Community is more than happy to <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">answer questions</a>, 
        and the same is certainly true for the MEI <a href="/community/technical-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Technical 
            Team</a>. Just take your time with this tutorial, and also have a closer look at the 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/introduction.html#meicustomization" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">corresponding MEI Guidelines chapter</a>.
        Eventually, you will become proficient in the discipline of using DH standards like MEI – just <b>continue</b> from here on :-)
