MEI is a non-profit, community-based organization, whose members are individuals and institutions -- universities, libraries, academic projects, research units, etc. The [Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/startseite.html) serves as the host institution for the MEI community.

In December 2014, the initial [MEI Board](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710210003/http://music-encoding.org/community/mei-organization/mei-board/ "MEI Board") was elected, consisting of three 3-member groups, each group serving a term of 2, 3 or 4 years. The Board is supported by a [Technical Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710210448/http://music-encoding.org:80/community/mei-organization/technical-team/ "Technical Team").
