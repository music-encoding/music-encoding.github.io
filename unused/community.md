MEI is a non-profit, community-based organization, whose members are institutions as universities, libraries, academic projects, research units, and individuals. The [Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/startseite.html "Mainz Akademie") serves as the host institution for the MEI community. For this purpose, a working group called "Arbeitskreis Musikcodierung" ("Working Group on Music Encoding") was created in February 2014, with Prof. Kurt Gärtner as convenor. By doing so, the Academy has granted access to Academy resources, such as administrative support and Academy venues, free of charge for MEI community meetings, conferences, workshops, and other gatherings. The Academy also administers funds for MEI.

In December 2014 the first [MEI Board](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html "MEI Board") was elected, consisting of three members each for terms of 2, 3 or 4 years. The MEI Board is supported by a [Technical Team](https://music-encoding.org/community/technical-team.html "Technical Team").

Community Membership in MEI is open to anyone with an interest in supporting the goals and purpose of MEI. There are two types of membership: Personal and Institutional Membership. For detailed information please refer to the [MEI By-laws](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-by-laws.html "By-laws").
