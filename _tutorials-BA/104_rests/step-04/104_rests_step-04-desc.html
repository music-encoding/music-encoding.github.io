        When music is laid out with multiple instruments / voices sharing a staff, it is sometimes 
        necessary to "push" events like notes to a later position in the measure, without saying they 
        are resting. This is usually the case when the document that's supposed to be encoded
        switches between chord-based notation and separated stems within a measure (cf. figure below). As MEI uses the
        <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/layer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;layer&gt;</a> element to lay out
        multiple instruments, and in these situations an instrument switches between those layers 
        mid-measure, the "gaps" in those measures need to be filled. This is what the 
        <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element is for.

        Of course, a space isn't really a rest. However, (invisible) rests are often (ab)used for these 
        purposes in other encoding formats or scorewriters. The benefit of MEI's <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element is that it carries no
        semantic meaning â€“ it just pushes other events around. This makes it much easier to actually process
        an encoding and extract individual voices for it, as no non-existent information-carrying element is
        falsely introduced just for better coordination.

        However, you can apply a certain duration to the <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element by using the <code>@dur</code>
        attribute. You can even use <code>@dots</code> to extend that duration by half its value. The duration you apply to
        <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> is the number of beats that the events, like a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, following the
        <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> are shifted to the right.

    <p class="task">
        In the editor below, you see a prefilled encoding of a note G4 (positioned at the first beat in the second layer).
        Please push this note to the end of the measure, so that it sits on the final beat under the D5, as in the image
        above. To do so, use the <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element and apply an appropriate duration (it must be 3 beats
        altogether). In fact, there are multiple ways to encode it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>with three <code>&lt;space&gt;</code>'s using the same value for <code>@dur</code>,</li>
        <li>with two <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> elements using only <code>@dur</code>, but with two different values,</li>
        <li>or even with only one <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element, using<code>@dur</code> and <code>@dots</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may play a little bit with the attribute values to see how they influence the rendering. Do you find all
        three possible solutions?
