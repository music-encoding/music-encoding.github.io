        Very often, a rest is supposed to fill up a complete measure, independent of the meter. 
        Of course it is possible to use regular <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> elements with the proper
        duration(s) for that – in case of a meter of 4/4, this would be just a 
        <code>&lt;rest dur="1"/&gt;</code>. However, in other meters this may require more markup.
        For that reason, MEI has a special element called <code>&lt;mRest/&gt;</code> – a 
        <i>measure rest</i>. This element needs no <code>@dur</code> attribute (even though it's 
        technically allowed to facilitate analytical processing), and will always fill up a 
        complete measure, independent of the meter. Therefore, you should not combine it with 
        other events in the same measure.

        Please turn the whole rest (which does not fit the meter) into an <code>&lt;mRest/&gt;</code>.
