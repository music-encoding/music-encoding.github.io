        Mostly in music organized in parts, there are frequently rests that last for more than one measure.

    </p>
    <p>
        In MEI, these rests are encoded using the special element <code>&lt;multiRest/&gt;</code>. It uses plain
        integers in the <code>@num</code> attribute to specify the number of measures which the performer of that 
        part is supposed to rest.

    <p class="task">
        Please encode a <code>&lt;multiRest/&gt;</code> lasting for 15 measures.
