    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, you learned how to encode rests with MEI. The elements you've learned are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/rest.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;rest&gt;</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/mrest.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;mRest&gt;</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/multirest.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;multiRest&gt;</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/space.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;space&gt;</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        These elements are almost always empty and have no child elements. With the space element, you 
        already learned about a fairly advanced mechanism of aligning multiple voices sharing a staff 
        in MEI. If you're interested in that, you may also want to investigate into the <code>@next</code> and 
    <code>@prev</code> attributes from MEI's 
        <a href="/guidelines/v4/attribute-classes/att.linking.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener, noreferrer">att.linking</a>
    attribute class (available on <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> and other events). That attribute class allows to
        lay "breadcrumbs" through an MEI file that make it possible to follow voices across multiple layers
        (and staves, if necessary). This would facilitate analytical use of your MEI file, and is not required in
        most situations, though.
