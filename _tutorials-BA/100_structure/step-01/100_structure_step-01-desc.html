        Step one: get accustomed with some very basic XML backgrounds and learn about the root
        element of MEI.
    </p>
    <p>
        MEI uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">XML</a> to represent music notation. XML is a hierarchical
        encoding system in which elements are the core objects. They are represented using so called “tags”. Most of the
        time these tags consist of an opening tag (that is a name enclosed in angle brackets like
        <code>&lt;element&gt;</code>) and its corresponding closing tag (<code>&lt;/element&gt;</code>). If there is no content
        between these two tags (like text or other elements) the element can be shortened to a so called self-closing
        tag of the form <code>&lt;element /&gt;</code>. In any case, every opened tag must be closed later on.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can think of an XML document like a tree that branches from one (outer) root element to nested (inner) child
        elements. The root element is the parent of all other elements. In MEI documents, this root element is called –
        for obvious reasons – <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code>, but it could have been any arbitrary name.
    </p>

    <p class="task">Enter a <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code> root element in the editor below. Do not forget to close the opening tag by a corresponding closing tag.</p>

        PS: We will cover some more basic XML principles in the next steps. For more detailed information consider to have a
        look at the dozens of materials available on the web, e.g. the
        <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Gentle Introduction to XML</a> of the
        Text Encoding Initative (<a href="https://tei-c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">TEI</a>).
