    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>
        You have just written a valid MEI file and successfully finished this tutorial. You should be able now</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to understand the basic principles of XML and how it is the basis for MEI</li>
        <li>to identify and to write the outermost basic structure of an MEI-conformant document
            including its title</li>
        <li>to differentiate between two main sections of a MEI file responsible for metadata information
            (<code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code>) or information about the musical content (<code>&lt;music&gt;</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since the topics addressed in this tutorial referred to the chapter <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/shared.html#sharedStructuralElements" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Structural Elements</a> of the MEI Guidelines,
        we recommend to consult this chapter whenever you need more detailed information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, a lot more is needed for a comprehensive MEI file – we left out all information about any musical
        content like measures, staves, or notes, and you also need to learn how to set up meter, key, and clefs.
        Here are some other tutorials we would like to recommend as next steps with MEI. Of course, you can always come
        back to these (or even this one) when you would like to remind yourself how to do certain things in MEI.
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as you have familiarized yourself with MEI to some degree, we invite you to share your
        experience with the <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Community</a>
        and write a tutorial on an aspect of MEI that you're particularly interested in. You don't have to be an expert
        for this – it's good to have tutorials on different levels, and very often a tutorial written by other beginners
        which just mastered a task is easier to follow than a guide written by someone who's not seeing the problem at all.
        We do have a <a href="./tutorials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">tutorial on how to write tutorials</a>,
        and there are templates to follow. It's that easy to become an active member of the MEI Community :-)
