        Step two: learn about the application and use of namespaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fine! As mentioned in the previous step, the name of the root element of an XML document is basically an arbitrary
        name that provides no meaning in itself for machine-processing. To make clear in which context an element is
        defined and to avoid name conflicts with elements, XML makes use of so called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">namespaces</a>.
        Namespaces can be declared by adding an <code>@xmlns</code> namespace declaration to the root element.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the MEI namespace is <code>http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei</code> and can be declared
        as follows: <code>xmlns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei"</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever you see an entity with a prepended <code>@</code>-sign in the text (like <code>@xmlns</code> above),
        this means we refer to an XML attribute. (This kind of reference is common practice and originates in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">XPath</a> language.)
        Attributes contain specified information (attribute values) that are related to elements. However, unlike
        elements, XML attributes do not have their own opening or closing brackets, but are placed solely inside the
        opening tag of an element, next to the element's name. They consist of the plain attribute's name connected by
        an equal sign to an attribute's value which must always be quoted (with single or double quotes). Multiple
        attributes are separated by blank spaces. Be aware that the <code>@</code>-sign is only prepended in textual
        descriptions, not in the encoding itself.

    <p class="task">In the editor below, add a MEI namespace declaration to the <code>MEI</code> root element.</p>
