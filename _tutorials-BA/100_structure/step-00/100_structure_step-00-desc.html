        In this tutorial, you will get accustomed with some very basic XML backgrounds and learn about the outermost
        structure of a valid MEI document. You will learn to identify different parts of an MEI file and which type of
        information you can expect in which part.

        However, after you have finished this tutorial, you may want to do other tutorials, which will introduce you to
        other important aspects of MEI. (Many of them include renderable music encodings.) These tutorials also serve as simple
        reference to MEI â€“ you can always go back to them.
