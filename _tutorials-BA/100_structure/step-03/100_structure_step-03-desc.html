        Step three: learn about the main child elements of the <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code> root element: <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;music&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well done! Now, that we have declared a namespace within our root element, all other elements nested in the root
        element can be resolved according to the MEI namespace by machine-processing.
    </p>
        As already mentioned, you can think of an XML document like a tree that branches from one (outer) root element
        to nested (inner) child elements. A MEI-encoded file contains at least two structures within the
        <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code> root element:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code> - contains a set of elements that supply metadata related to the MEI encoding, including
            bibliographic information, responsibility statements, encoding standards, or provenance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;music&gt;</code> - contains a set of elements that provide for the encoding of the actual musical content.
            Beside others, it may comprise structural elements to describe the form of a musical piece (sections,
            movements, document groups), or notational elements, like e.g. notes, rest, articluations, or dynamics.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="task">In the editor below, add a <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;music&gt;</code> element inside the
        <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code> root element.</p>
