    <p>
        Congratulations, you've <b>just encoded</b> your first note in MEI. Now let's continue and add a couple more notes to encode
        your first simple sequence of notes:
        <img style="display: block; margin: .5rem auto; width: 240px;" src="./101_note-sequence.png" alt="Sequence of notes"/>
    </p>
    <p class="task">
        Please try to reproduce the sequence above with MEI (you can copy & paste the first note element as needed). Each note needs one <code>@pname</code>, <code>@oct</code> and <code>@dur</code> attribute. Keep in mind that pitch names are given as lower-case strings (ranging from <code>a</code> to <code>g</code>) in MEI.
    </p>
