    <p>In order to encode a note, all relevant information needs to be recorded in machine-readable form. Depending
        on a project's needs, the selection of what is relevant and what is not may differ, but for the purpose of 
        this introduction, let's agree on the most basic information of a note: It's written pitch and duration. In 
        order to express pitch, MEI uses 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Scientific Pitch Notation</a>,
        where the so-called middle-C is expressed as "C4". However, it separates that into two separate pieces of 
        information: The pitch name (in MEI called <code>@pname</code>), and the octave (<code>@oct</code>). This separation has
        various reasons, which are of no importance here. It is also important to note that pitch names are given as
        lower-case strings in MEI.</p>
    <p>The other important information is, of course, duration (<code>@dur</code>). Here, simple integer values are used
        to indicate the duration of a note. A full note gets a value of <code>1</code>, a half note needs <code>2</code>,
        a quarter <code>4</code> and so on.</p>
    <p class="task">We would like to ask you to enter the following code into the editor box: 
        <code>&lt;note pname="e" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;</code>. You should then see the note rendered. You may play a little
        bit with the attribute values to see how they influence the rendering. You will also see hints on how to write the
        correct code. Whenever you're ready, make sure to have the correct code in the editor, and then hit the "continue" 
        button on the lower right.</p>
    <p>
        PS: If you're not too familiar with XML: Whenever we refer to attributes, we prepend their name with the @-sign. 
        This is common practice and originates in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">XPath</a>
        language. When writing them in XML, you must not include the @-sign, but write the attribute's name only. Feel
        free to have a look at our <a href="/tutorials/100-structure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">tutorial on XML basics</a>.
