        In this tutorial, you will learn how to encode a very simple melody in MEI. You will learn how to describe
        the most basic aspects of music notation as structured data, so that computers can parse your code.

        The code you write will be immediately rendered, and the rendering will respond to your changes. That way,
        you will get a feeling on how the different parameters interact.

        After you have finished this tutorial, you may want to do other tutorials, which will introduce you other
        important aspects of MEI. These tutorials also serve as simple reference to MEI â€“ you can always go back to them.
