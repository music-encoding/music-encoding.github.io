    <p>Congratulations, you've <b>just encoded</b> your first sequence of notes in MEI. Now let's adjust some duration values to encode your first simple melody – you certainly know "Mary had a little lamb":
        <img style="display: block; margin: .5rem auto; width: 240px;" src="./101_note-little-lamb.png" alt="Mary had a little lamb"/></p>
    <p class="task">
        Please try to reproduce the melody above with MEI. Each note needs <code>@pname</code>, <code>@oct</code> and <code>@dur</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that the <code>@dur</code> attribute can have values like <code>"1"</code>, <code>"2"</code>, <code>"4"</code>,
        <code>"8"</code> or <code>"16"</code> to indicate different rhythmical values.
        For the first note, you need an additional <code>@dots</code> attribute, where you need to specify
        the number of dots as an integer – in this case, it's simply a <code>dots="1"</code>.
    </p>
