    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>You just finished your first tutorial about MEI, and you should be able to encode a very simple melody with
        MEI already. Of course, a lot more is needed for a complete MEI file – we left out all structural information
        about measures and staves, and you also need to learn how to set up meter, key, and clefs. As next steps with 
        MEI, we would like to recommend our tutorials on
        <a href="/tutorials/103-chords.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">chords</a> or
        <a href="/tutorials/104-rests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">rests</a>.
        Of course, you can always come back to
        these (or even this one) when you would like to remind yourself how to do certain things in MEI.</p>
    <p>As soon as you have familiarized yourself with MEI to some degree, we invite you to share your 
        experience with the MEI Community and write a tutorial on an aspect of MEI that you're particularly 
        interested in. You don't have to be an expert for this – it's good to have tutorials on different levels.
        Often a tutorial written by other beginners which just mastered a task is easier to follow than
        a guide written by someone who's not seeing the problem at all. We do have a tutorial on how to write
        tutorials, and there are templates to follow. It's that easy to become an active member of the MEI Community :-)</p>
