        Macros are the last part of ODD that is needed to fully understand the specifications of MEI, and they are clearly the
        least important aspect. Macros are placeholders for elements which can be added to the <em>&lt;content&gt;</em>
        of an element in one go. The most-used macro is probably <em>macro.struc-unstrucContent</em>, which is defined as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;macroSpec ident="macro.struc-unstrucContent" module="MEI.shared" type="pe"&gt;
        &lt;desc&gt;Provides a choice between structured and unstructured/mixed content.&lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;content&gt;
            &lt;rng:choice&gt;
                &lt;rng:group&gt;
                    &lt;rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
                        &lt;rng:ref name="model.headLike" /&gt;
                    &lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
                    &lt;rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
                        &lt;rng:ref name="model.pLike" /&gt;
                    &lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
                &lt;/rng:group&gt;
                &lt;rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
                    &lt;rng:choice&gt;
                        &lt;rng:text/&gt;
                        &lt;rng:ref name="model.textPhraseLike.limited" /&gt;
                    &lt;/rng:choice&gt;
                &lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
            &lt;/rng:choice&gt;
        &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/macroSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Macros again use the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-macroSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer"><em>&lt;macroSpec&gt;</em></a>
        element, but this time with a <em>@type</em> with value "<em>pe</em>". The names, which are again stored in <em>@ident</em>,
        are prefixed with a "<em>macro.</em>", and of course we have a <em>&lt;desc&gt;</em> again. The main difference to <em>model
        classes</em> is that <em>macro</em>s do not substitute for elements alone, but also for more complex rules about combinations
        of elements. Here, <em>macro.struc-unstrucContent</em> provides a good example. It forces the <em>user</em> to decide between 
        a structured encoding model (using a dedicated <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element, followed by a series of paragraphs), or an 
        unstructured model (where textual content is directly inserted and may be marked up with a variety of elements). It can be used 
        inside elements like <em>&lt;watermark&gt;</em>, and is helpful to avoid having to redefine the same combination of elements in
        numerous places.
    </p>    
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;elementSpec ident="watermark" module="MEI.header"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Contains a description of a watermark or similar device.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;!-- memberships skipped for brevity --&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;
        &lt;rng:ref name="macro.struc-unstrucContent" /&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;!-- remarks skipped for brevity --&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        In essence, the <em>&lt;rng:ref&gt;</em> inside the <em>&lt;elementSpec&gt;</em> is just replaced with the child elements of
        the <em>&lt;macroSpec&gt;</em>'s <em>&lt;content&gt;</em>, so that it's possible to combine a <em>macro</em> with other contents. <em>Macros</em>
        therefore serve as predefined, re-usable spec blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like I mentioned earlier, <em>macros</em> are not the most important aspect of ODD from an MEI perspective, and so you should have 
        been able to get all that's necessary already. That means you're done with this final step – let's <strong>continue</strong> for some closing remarks…
