        <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've successfully made your way through this introduction into ODD from an MEI
        perspective. You should now know and understand all the building blocks of the MEI specification. Admittedly, it has 
        been a tough ride, and you may have to re-read it a couple of times to really familiarize yourself. What is important
        to keep in mind is that the version of ODD MEI currently uses is slightly outdated, and may not be perfectly aligned 
        with the TEI documentation anymore. Nevertheless, all MEI tools and workflows are operating properly with this version,
        so from an MEI perspective, there is nothing wrong with the current situation.

        The next step from here on is to learn how to write actual <strong>MEI customizations</strong> using ODD. There is
        a separate tutorial for this (or will be soonâ€¦), which will go into the details of that process. Such customizations
        will use some additional concepts on top of what you've learned here, but it is crucial to fully understand the 
        underlying concepts first. As soon as you feel like you've understood ODD so far, this extra level shouldn't worry 
        you anymore. And with proper customizations, you will be able to make expert use of MEI for your needs :)
