        Despite it's name, the setup for working with ODD usually requires at least <u>two</u> <em>logical</em> files (though these may spread 
        across many more files in the file system, as shown in the following step of this tutorial). The first of these files is the 
        so-called <em>source</em>: It holds the full specification of the format, in this case MEI. In our repository, it is located in the
        <a href="https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/blob/develop/source/mei-source.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">mei-source.xml</a> file. 
        In addition to that file, a separate <em>customization</em> is required to specify which parts of the specification are to be used
        in a given context. The whole purpose of ODD is to allow flexible customizations of the schema. MEI provides a set of 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/introduction.html#meiprofiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">pre-defined profiles</a>,
        which are nothing but customizations of the MEI schema. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use MEI (or any other ODD-based format), the <em>customization</em> file is used to
        control how the <em>source</em> file shall be compiled. There are several target formats for that
        compilation, which is explained elsewhere<!-- TODO: Add reference to second tutorial -->. The most
        common target is a <a href="https://relaxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">RelaxNG</a> file, which contains
        both RelaxNG hierarchies and additional Schematron rules as defined in the ODD, and can be used for 
        validation against both types of schema. All other possible output formats are not commonly used for 
        MEI. (Side note: we'll come back to a brief explanation of Schematron later in this tutorial.)

        While this tutorial is focussed on explaining the basic principles of the ODD structures as found in the MEI sources, a separate tutorial
        on ODD will explain how to customize MEI to specific needs. The following steps will introduce the mechanisms of the main ODD structures in MEI: 
        modules, elements, models, attributes, datatypes and macros. Let's <strong>continue</strong> in order to start with a closer look at <em>modules</em>â€¦
