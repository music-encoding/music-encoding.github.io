        As we've seen on the previous step, a lot of the MEI hierarchy is established through the use of model classes. A very similar
        mechanism is used by ODD to make attributes available on multiple elements. But before dealing with attribute classes, let's have 
        a brief look on how an attribute is actually defined in ODD. The <em>@xml:id</em> attribute is available on every MEI element, and 
        is defined with the following specs:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;attDef ident="xml:id" usage="opt"&gt;
        &lt;desc&gt;Regularizes the naming of an element and thus facilitates building links between it and other resources. Each id attribute within a document must have a unique value.&lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;datatype maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="1"&gt;
            &lt;rng:data type="ID"/&gt;
        &lt;/datatype&gt;
    &lt;/attDef&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Attributes are specified using the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-attDef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;attDef&gt;</a>
        element, and follow some conventions we've already seen on elements and model classes: Their name is provided in the <em>@ident</em> attribute, 
        and they have a <em>&lt;desc&gt;</em> element with a brief description. What is new is the <strong>@usage</strong> attribute, which specifies
        when to use the attribute specified. The value here, "<em>opt</em>", is used for optional attributes – <em>@xml:id</em> can be used on all MEI 
        elements, but doesn't have to be used. Other allowed values for <em>@usage</em> are "<em>req</em>" (required) and "<em>rec</em>" (recommended when 
        applicable). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's have a look for these <em>&lt;attDef&gt;</em> elements are located. Even though that's not really the preferred solution, sometimes
        attributes are defined at the element where they need to be used, as with the <em>@type</em> attribute on 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/meihead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;meiHead&gt;</a>:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;elementSpec ident="meiHead" module="MEI.header"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;(MEI header) – Supplies the descriptive and declarative metadata prefixed to every
        MEI-conformant text.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;!-- memberOf elements skipped for brevity --&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;
        &lt;!-- contents skipped for brevity --&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;!-- constraintSpecs skipped for brevity --&gt;
    &lt;attList&gt;
        &lt;attDef ident="type" usage="opt"&gt;
            &lt;desc&gt;Specifies the kind of document to which the header is attached, for example whether it
                is a corpus or individual text.&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;valList type="closed"&gt;
                &lt;valItem ident="music"&gt;
                    &lt;desc&gt;Header is attached to a music document.&lt;/desc&gt;
                &lt;/valItem&gt;
                &lt;valItem ident="corpus"&gt;
                    &lt;desc&gt;Header is attached to a corpus.&lt;/desc&gt;
                &lt;/valItem&gt;
                &lt;valItem ident="independent"&gt;
                    &lt;desc&gt;Header is independent; i.e., not attached to either a music or a corpus
                        document.&lt;/desc&gt;
                &lt;/valItem&gt;
            &lt;/valList&gt;
        &lt;/attDef&gt;
    &lt;/attList&gt;
    &lt;!-- remarks skipped for brevity --&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        As we can see, attributes are just contained in an <em>&lt;attList&gt;</em> child inside the <em>&lt;elementSpec&gt;</em>. However, in most cases,
        an attribute is supposed to be available on more than one element. The <em>@xml:id</em> attribute introduced above is available on every MEI 
        element, so it would have to be defined several hundred times – again, that's neither maintainable nor efficient. Instead, ODD again utilizes
        a class system, this time for <strong>attribute classes</strong>. Let's have a look how <em>@xml:id</em> is actually distributed into
        MEI using the <em>att.id</em> attribute class:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;classSpec ident="att.id" module="MEI.shared" type="atts"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Attributes that uniquely identify an element.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;attList org="group"&gt;
        &lt;attDef ident="xml:id" usage="opt"&gt;
            &lt;!-- skipping this, as it is the very same as in the example above --&gt;
        &lt;/attDef&gt;
    &lt;/attList&gt;
&lt;/classSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        We've already seen the <em>&lt;attDef&gt;</em>, and there is no difference between attributes defined within an element or within an attribute class. 
        But we've also already seen the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-classSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;classSpec&gt;</a> element
        on <em>model classes</em>. The only difference is that attribute classes use the <strong>@type="atts"</strong> attribute, and while the names of
        model classes already start with "<em>model.</em>", attribute classes in MEI will always have a name starting with "<em>att.</em>". 
    </p>
    <p>
        Earlier in this tutorial, we saw the definition of the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/role.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;role&gt;</a>
        element. Let's have a look on it again, skipping some parts of it:
    </p>    
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;elementSpec ident="role" module="MEI.shared"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Name of a dramatic role, as given in a cast list.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.common"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.facsimile"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.lang"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;!-- skipping content and remarks here --&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        According to this, <em>&lt;role&gt;</em> is a <em>&lt;memberOf&gt;</em> the attribute classes <em>att.common</em>, <em>att.facsimile</em>, and 
        <em>att.lang</em>, but not <em>att.id</em>. Yet still, the documentation of <em>&lt;role&gt;</em> states that <em>@xml:id</em> is available. The answer
        to this is again the use of <em>nested classes</em>. <em>&lt;role&gt;</em> subscribes to the <em>att.common</em> attribute class and gets all attributes 
        from that class (which are none, actually). <em>att.common</em> in turn subscribes (= is a member of) to the <em>att.basic</em> attribute class (among
        other classes), which brings in the <em>@xml:base</em> attribute, and which subscribes to the <em>att.id</em> attribute class, which eventually brings in
        <em>@xml:id</em>. To see that mechanism in action, let's have a brief look at <em>att.common</em>:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;classSpec ident="att.common" module="MEI.shared" type="atts"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Attributes common to many elements.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.basic"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.labelled"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.linking"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.nNumberLike"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.responsibility"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.typed"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
&lt;/classSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Again, it is through the use of a <em>&lt;memberOf</em> element with the proper <em>@key</em> how membership in different classes is achieved in 
        MEI, so this mechanism should be familiar already. And just like with <em>model classes</em>, <em>attribute classes</em> are used from rather generic
        classes to very specific sets of well-aligned attributes. By subscribing to the right attribute class(es), an element may thus get just the right set of 
        attributes, and it becomes possible to selectively add or remove attributes to new or existing elements by modifying these memberships.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In specs for <em>att.common</em> above reveal another attribute class <em>att.typed</em> which provides an attribute 
        <em>@type</em>. Obviously, this hasn't been used on <em>&lt;meiHead&gt;</em>, as seen above. The reason is that the attribute class
        provides a <em>@type</em> attribute which has only a very generic description: <em>Designation which characterizes the element 
            in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology that employs single-token labels.</em> 
        Compared to that, the <em>@type</em> on <em>&lt;meiHead&gt;</em> had a very strict definition. In general, MEI seeks to avoid
        using the same attribute name with multiple definitions, but that's not always possible, and at least doesn't cause 
        <em>technical</em> confusion. With the "by class" perspective on attributes (see the 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/meihead.html#attributes" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;meiHead&gt;</a> specs),
        its possible to easily trace where any allowed attribute comes from. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The only major part left to understand ODD as it is used to define MEI are data types, which will be introduced in the 
        following step of this tutorial.
