        ODD, an acronym for <em>One Document Does-it-all</em>, is a part of the 
        <a href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/customization/getting-started-with-p5-odds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">TEI standard</a>, 
        and is also used to define TEI itself.    
    </p>
    <p>
        ODD uses a set of special elements in the <a href="https://tei-c.org/ns/1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">TEI namespace</a> to
        describe XML-based data formats. Besides core TEI, it is used for TEI-based formats like 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">EpiDoc</a>, but also for technically independent
        formats like MEI. In 2016, the TEI came up with a version of ODD called 
        <em><a href="https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/ODD#.22Pure_ODD.22" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Pure ODD</a></em>. As of Summer 2020, 
        MEI however continues to use the older flavor of ODD, as the new version brings no pertinent benefits for MEI, but would
        result in significant maintenance work for various MEI-related tools and workflows. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The main difference to <em>Pure ODD</em> is that the older version used by MEI uses elements from the 
        <em><a href="https://relaxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">RelaxNG</a></em> namespace. Eventually, ODD files are usually compiled
        to a RelaxNG (or XSD) schema anyway, as there is literally no software support for direct validation against ODD. However,
        this recourse to RelaxNG within ODD adds an additional dependency into the TEI workflow, and thus reduces the technical freedom
        for defining TEI and / or ODD to some (minor?) degree. As MEI is already defined in a format that is out of (direct) control
        of the MEI community, and needs to deal with multiple XML namespaces anyway, the argument to have everything defined consistently 
        in <em>Pure ODD</em> is less striking, and accordingly hasn't been followed so far.
