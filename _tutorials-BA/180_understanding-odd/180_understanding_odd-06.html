        As we've seen, ODD allows to specify which exact child elements are allowed inside a given
        element. This allows for a very fine-grained control of the MEI hierarchy, but it comes at 
        the cost of very verbose listings of what each element may contain. This is neither particularly 
        maintainable nor easy to follow: Some elements in MEI may contain dozens of other elements,
        and comparing two such elements is rather cumbersome.

        Among others, the 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/castitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;castItem&gt;</a>
        element from the last step of this tutorial had a child element  
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/role.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;role&gt;</a>. The documentation
        for <em>&lt;role&gt;</em> lists a total of 54 child elements, plus textual content:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="./role-children.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        Looking at the <em>&lt;elementSpec&gt;</em> there is no such listing, however:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;elementSpec ident="role" module="MEI.shared"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Name of a dramatic role, as given in a cast list.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.common"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.facsimile"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="att.lang"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;
        &lt;rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
            &lt;rng:choice&gt;
                &lt;rng:text/&gt;
                &lt;rng:ref name="model.textPhraseLike.limited" /&gt;
            &lt;/rng:choice&gt;
        &lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;remarks&gt;
        &lt;p part="N"&gt;This element is modelled on an element in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/remarks&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Instead of the 54 elements from the screenshot above, only one <em>&lt;rng:ref&gt;</em> is given, pointing to something
        named <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>. This is a so-called <strong>model class</strong>. Model classes are intended to
        serve as placeholders for groups of elements. The model class itself does not know which elements are part of it: 
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;classSpec ident="model.textPhraseLike.limited" module="MEI.shared" type="model"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Groups textual elements that occur at the level of individual words or phrases. This class is equivalent to the model.textPhraseLike class without the pb element.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="model.rdgPart.text"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="model.editTransPart.text"/&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="model.textPhraseLike"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
&lt;/classSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        A model class is encoded with a 
        <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-classSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;classSpec&gt;</a> element,
        which has the <strong>@type="model"</strong> attribute. Like elements, it's uniquely identified using the <strong>@ident</strong>
        attribute. It is assigned to one of the MEI modules with the <em>@module</em> attribute. 
        MEI follows the convention that all model class names are prefixed with the string "<em>model.</em>". They also always have 
        a <em>&lt;desc&gt;</em> with a brief explanation of the purpose of the group. Let's skip the <em>&lt;memberOf&gt;</em> elements on 
        <em>&lt;classSpec&gt;</em> from the example above for a moment, and let's see how those 54 elements we've seen above are bound to 
        <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If we go to the MEI Guidelines for 
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/model-classes/model.textphraselike.limited.html#members" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">model.textPhraseLike.limited</a>,
        we see that six elements are direct "<em>members</em>" of this model class: <em>&lt;dedicatee&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;dimensions&gt;</em>, 
        <em>&lt;extent&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;seg&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;symbol&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;term&gt;</em>. Let's have a look into <em>&lt;dedicatee&gt;</em>:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;elementSpec ident="dedicatee" module="MEI.shared"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Entity to whom a creative work is formally offered.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;-- other memberShips removed for brevity --&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="model.textPhraseLike.limited"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;
        &lt;rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
            &lt;rng:choice&gt;
                &lt;rng:text/&gt;
                &lt;rng:ref name="model.textPhraseLike.limited" /&gt;
            &lt;/rng:choice&gt;
        &lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;-- constraintSpec removed for brevity--&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        The element has a <em>&lt;memberOf&gt;</em> element, which uses its <strong>@key</strong> attribute to reference the 
        <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em> model class. So, an element claims membership in a given model class, and it will be automatically allowed 
        everywhere this model class is allowed within the <em>&lt;content&gt;</em> of an element. As a side note: this means that <em>&lt;dedicatee&gt;</em> may be
        self-nested (one dedicatee element may contain another dedicatee as child element), which is rather a side effect of the class system than an 
        intended feature of MEIâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in regular MEI only six elements are direct members of <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>, but we saw that by referencing this model
        class, a total of 54 elements are added as allowed content (= child elements). Where do the remaining 48 elements come from? Admittedly, the current 
        presentation of the Guidelines doesn't present well where those additional elements come from. The answer are 
        <strong>nested model classes</strong>. One model class can be a member of another model class, as we've seen in the <em>&lt;classSpec&gt;</em>
        above. Let's go back to the allowed children of the <em>&lt;role&gt;</em> element, but in the <em>by class</em> perspective:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="./role-children-byclass.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        We see the six direct children listed, but also that <em>&lt;fig&gt;</em> is listed under the <em>model.figureLike</em> label, and <em>&lt;catchwords&gt;</em>
        and <em>&lt;fingerprint&gt;</em> are coming from <em>model.msInline</em>.
        <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/role.html#mayContain" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">This listing</a> continues and explains the origin of all
        54 elements. If we have a look at <em>model.figureLike</em>, we see that this class has a <em>&lt;memberOf&gt;</em>, pointing to <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;classSpec ident="model.figureLike" module="MEI.figtable" type="model"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;Groups elements representing or containing graphic information such as an illustration or figure.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;classes&gt;
        &lt;memberOf key="model.textPhraseLike.limited"/&gt;
    &lt;/classes&gt;
&lt;/classSpec&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        So, <em>model.figureLike</em> is a member of <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>, which means that wherever <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>
        is allowed as child content, <em>model.figureLike</em> (and all the elements which are members of it) is also allowed. The deepest <em>nesting</em>
        of classes within <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em> is actually three: <em>model.nameLike.geogName</em> is a member of <em>model.nameLike.place</em>, 
        which is a member of <em>model.nameLike</em>, which is a member of <em>model.textPhraseLike.limited</em>. All elements which are members of any of those
        classes will be allowed as children of any element which has a &lt;rng:ref name="model.textPhraseLike.limited" /&gt; in its <em>&lt;content&gt;</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see from the names in that class hierarchy above, more specific classes are members of more generic classes. When trying to identify the
        set of elements that should be allowed inside a given (new) element, one may purposely pick a class that adds some very specific elements, or that 
        brings a very wide slate of elements. This system of model classes makes it very easy to be very selective on the allowed contents of elements. It 
        also makes it very easy to introduce new elements into MEI: By subscribing to existing model classes, those elements will be automatically included
        in the schema in all the places those model classes are allowed already.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's move on to <em>attributes</em>, which are handled in a very similar manner.
