        Step two: encode a simple chord (triad).
    </p>
    <p>
        Well done! Now it's time to make a <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> out of these three <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>s. As mentioned
        in the previous step, you should enclose the note elements in a chord element and move the duration attributes
        from the notes to the chord.
    </p>
    <p class="task">
        In the editor below, enclose the three <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements in a <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> element (i.e. insert
        the opening tag of <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> before the first note and the closing tag after the last one). The three
        single notes should now be rendered not sequentially, but vertically aligned, but they lack a correct duration
        yet. So remove the duration attributes from all the notes and add one to the <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> instead. Keep
        the duration of a quarter (<code>@dur="4"</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        You should then see the chord rendered. Again, you may play a little bit with the attribute values to see how they
        influence the rendering. You will also see hints on how to write the correct code. Whenever you're ready, make
        sure to have the correct code in the editor, and then hit the "continue" button on the lower right.
