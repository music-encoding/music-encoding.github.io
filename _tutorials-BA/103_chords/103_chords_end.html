    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>You just finished this basic tutorial about chords in MEI, and you should be able to encode some simple chord
        progressions with MEI already.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, a lot more is needed for a comprehensive MEI file – we left out all structural information
        about measures and staves, and you also need to learn how to set up meter, key, and clefs. As next steps with
        MEI, we would like to recommend our tutorial on <a href="/tutorials/104-rests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">rests</a>.
        Of course, you can always come back to these (or even this one) when you would like to remind yourself how to do
        certain things in MEI.
    </p>

        As soon as you have familiarized yourself with MEI to some degree, we invite you to share your experience with
        the <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Community</a>
        and write a tutorial on an aspect of MEI that you're particularly interested in. You don't have to be an expert
        for this – it's good to have tutorials on different levels. Often a tutorial written by other beginners which
        just mastered a task is easier to follow than a guide written by someone who's not seeing the problem at all.
        We do have a <a href="/tutorials/tutorials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">tutorial on how to write
        tutorials</a>, and there are templates to follow. It's that easy to become an active member of the MEI
        Community :-)
