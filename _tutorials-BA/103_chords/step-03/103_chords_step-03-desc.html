        Step three: encode a simple sequence of chords.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perfect, you have just encoded a chord in MEI. Now let's continue and add a couple more chords to encode a simple
        sequence of chords:

        <img style="display: block; margin: .5rem auto; width: 240px;" src="./103_chord-sequence.png" alt="Simple chord sequence"/>
    </p>
    <p class="task">
        In the editor below, please try to reproduce the chord sequence above with MEI. Notes are enclosed by chord
        elements. Each chord needs a <code>@dur</code> attribute, and each note needs <code>@pname</code> and
        <code>@oct</code> attributes.
