        Step one: provide some notes for a chord.
    </p>
    <p>
        In MEI, the notion of a chord means the "simultaneous sounding of two or more notes in the same layer with the
        same duration" (see <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/elements/chord.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Element specification</a>).
        Thus, a chord is made up of two or more note elements that belong to the same voice (layer) and have an identical
        rhythmical structure (duration). (There are cases where you don't want to have the same duration on every note
        of a chord, but these are not part of this basic tutorial.)
    </p>
    <p>
        To encode such a "simultaneous sounding", the <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> element is used in MEI. Its use is pretty
        straightforward: Multiple <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements within the same layer are enclosed by a <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code>
        element and the duration attribute (@dur) is moved from the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>s to the <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code>
        element (since the duration is the same for all notes). However, whether you write an outer <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code>
        element first to add some inner <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements, or whether you start with the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>s
        and then enclose them in a <code>&lt;chord&gt;</code> element, does not actually matter in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this tutorial, let's stick to the second approach: This means, we need some notes first.
    </p>
    <p class="task">
        In the editor below, please enter the following three <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;note pname="e" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;note pname="g" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;note pname="c" oct="5" dur="4"/&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        You should then see the three notes rendered sequentially. Not much of a chord, actually. But don't worry: We will
        care about that right away in the next step. Until then, you may play a little bit with the attribute values to
        see how they influence the rendering. You will also see hints on how to write the correct code. Whenever you're
        ready, make sure to have the correct code in the editor, and then hit the "continue" button on the lower right.
