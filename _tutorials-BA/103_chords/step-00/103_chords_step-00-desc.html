        In this tutorial, you will learn how to encode chords in MEI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the concept of a chord is strongly based on notes, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the
        encoding of notes before this tutorial, e.g. in our
        <a href="./101-quickstart.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Quickstart tutorial</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code you write will be immediately rendered, and the rendering will respond to your changes. That way, you
        will get a feeling on how the different parameters interact.

        After you have finished this tutorial, you may want to do other tutorials, which will introduce you other
        important aspects of MEI. These tutorials also serve as simple reference to MEI â€“ you can always go back to them.
