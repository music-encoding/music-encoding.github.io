    <p class="tutorialGoal">Step five: combining what you've learned in the last two steps, encoding at once the structure of the next measure and the second note of the example.</p>

    <p class="task">In the editor below, add another <code>&lt;measure&gt;</code> element (<code>@n="1"</code>) with staff (also <code>@n="1"</code>) and with layer next to the existing pickup measure. Add the second note of the example (a quarter note e flat 4) to this new measure. Don’t worry about the measure's content being too short in the given time signature – you’ll fill it in in the next steps.</p>

    <p>PS: The encoding will be rendered as soon as you will have entered the new note.</p>
