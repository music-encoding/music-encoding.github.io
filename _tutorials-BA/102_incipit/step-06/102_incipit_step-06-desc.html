    <p>Great! You have encoded the first note of the first full measure. The next two notes of the example are grouped under a beam. To express this in MEI, the <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> element is to be used. <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> is a container for a series of explicitly beamed events (like notes, rests or chords) that begins and ends entirely within the same measure.</p>

    <p class="task">In the editor below, please add a <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> element at the specified position before adding the two child <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>s separately (e flat and g). Do remember to include the corresponding attribute values on the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements.</p>
