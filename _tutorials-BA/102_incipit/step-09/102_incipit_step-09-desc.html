    <p class="tutorialGoal">Step nine: Encoding the note values of the final two measures of the example.</p>

    <p>Wonderful, you've encoded the second measure! Now we will increase the level of difficulty a little bit more: the final two measures are waiting. But don't worry: this is the most ambitious step of this tutorial. Promise!</p>

    <p>To encode the final two measures you will need to know about one more element: A pause is encoded with a <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> element having a <code>@dur</code> attribute similar to the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element. But, of course, a <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> has neither <code>@pname</code> nor <code>@oct</code> attributes. You can ignore the additional elements, such as dynamics, slurs or accents at this point as they will be addressed separately in the next final steps.</p>

    <p class="task">Please encode the final two measures (<code>@n=3</code> & <code>@n=4</code>) of the example in the editor below. Add <code>&lt;measure&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;staff&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;layer&gt;</code> elements as well as the corresponding <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> elements. Keep in mind how the <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> element is used to group the corresponding <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements.</p>

    <p>Again, there is no prefilled content in the editor box for this step. If you feel lost or unsure at any time, try to follow the hints that are displayed below the editor box. That should guide you through this task.</p>
