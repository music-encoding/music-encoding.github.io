    <p class="tutorialGoal">Step seven: encoding dotted durations.</p>

    <p>The next two notes in the example introduce a new rhythmic figure, including a dotted quarter and an eighth note. To encode a dotted rhythm, you need to use the <code>@dots</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element and set the number of dots as the attribute's value, e.g. <code>“1”</code> for one dot or <code>“2”</code> for two dots.</p>

    <p class="task">Please encode the rest of the measure (<code>@n=1</code>) in the editor below by adding two <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements with different rhythmic values (dotted quarter, eighth) next to the <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> element that you have added in the previous step.</p>
