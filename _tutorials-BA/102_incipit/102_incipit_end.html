    <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
    <p>You have now successfully finished this advanced tutorial, and you should be able to encode a single melody of one voice with multiple measures, different note and rest values, beams, slurs and dynamics.</p>

    <p>Here are some other tutorials we would like to recommend as next steps with MEI. Of course, you can always come back to these (or even this one) when you would like to remind yourself how to do certain things in MEI.</p>

    <p>As soon as you have familiarized yourself with MEI to some degree, we invite you to share your experience with the <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Community</a> and write a tutorial on an aspect of MEI that you're particularly interested in. You don't have to be an expert for this – it's good to have tutorials on different levels. Often a tutorial written by other beginners which just mastered a task is easier to follow than a guide written by someone who's not seeing the problem at all. We do have a <a href="./tutorials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">tutorial on how to write tutorials</a>, and there are templates to follow. It's that easy to become an active member of the MEI Community :-)</p>
