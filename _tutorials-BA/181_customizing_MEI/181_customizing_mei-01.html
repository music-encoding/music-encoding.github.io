    <h1>Customizing ODD</h1>
    <p>
        This is an advanced tutorial that introduces how to customize MEI for project-specific needs. It assumes a solid understanding of the 
        internal ODD structures of MEI, as described in the <a href="/tutorials/103-chords.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Understanding ODD</a>
        tutorial. If you're not familiar with <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-elementSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;elementSpec&gt;</a>
        elements, model classes and attribute classes, it is probably better to go back to <a href="/tutorials/103-chords.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">that tutorial</a> first.

        Now let's start with our current tutorial. The <em>purpose</em> of customizations is to <em>restrict</em> the MEI schema to just those
        parts of the framework which are relevant for a given task or project. It is also possible to <em>extend</em> MEI using the same
        mechanisms described here, but this is left to yet another tutorial. For now, the focus is on subsetting MEI, though, as files 
        validated against such a customized version of MEI will also validate against the 
        <a href="/resources/schemas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI All</a> customization, which resembles the full 
        MEI framework. This ensures a substantial level of compatibility with existing tools and documentation. In general, extensions to MEI
        should be made only when absolutely necessary, and it's usually a good idea in such situations to consult with the 
        <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Community</a> to verify that no other 
        solution exists already.

        In this tutorial, we will first learn how to use the <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI ProfileDrafter</a>,
        which provides a graphical user interface for generating basic restricting customizations. It is part of the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Garage</a>, and while being somewhat limited, it
        definitely helps to better understand the concepts of MEI Customizations. Next, we will examine the output
        of the MEI ProfileDrafter and see how to generate a RelaxNG file for validation purposes from that. Finally, we will introduce
        some more advanced customization options, which are beyond the scope of the MEI ProfileDrafter. You may want to use a XML Editor
        application at some point to follow along, but we'll be using web services for all processing, so it really doesn't matter which
        editor you choose â€“ any is fine. With that out of the way, let's get started!
