        Regular MEI allows the following <strong>document elements</strong>: <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;music&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;meiCorpus&gt;</code>. This means that these elements may serve as outermost
        elements in an MEI file. However, a project may come up with a data structure that requires other or additional start elements. 
        For instance, a project may decide to keep all editorial annotations as separate files, each containing its own <code>&lt;annot&gt;</code>
        element. The official <a href="/guidelines/dev/content/introduction.html#meiprofiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">mei-all_anyStart</a>
        customization allows to use every single element in the MEI Namespace as start element, but this is mostly for teaching purposes and is not 
        recommendable for practical use. Instead, ODD offers a simple mechanism to define the allowed start elements, using the initial
        <code>&lt;schemaSpec&gt;</code> element.

    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;schemaSpec ident="mei" 
    ns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei" 
    prefix="mei_" 
    start="mei meiHead meiCorpus music"&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, the <code>@start</code>-attribute is used as a space-separated list of all start elements. If the project mentioned above decided 
        to allow <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;annot&gt;</code>, but disallow all other start elements, this could be modified like so:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;schemaSpec ident="mei" 
    ns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei" 
    prefix="mei_" 
    start="mei annot"&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, adjusting start elements is actually quite easy. Let's wrap up what we've learned about customizing ODD.
