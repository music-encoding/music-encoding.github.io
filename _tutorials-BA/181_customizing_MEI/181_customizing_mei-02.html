        For the following steps, you should open the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI ProfileDrafter</a>
        in a separate browser window (or tab) to follow along with these instructions.

        When you open the ProfileDrafter, you will see a list of all MEI Modules in the center column. For each, 
        the number of elements and attribute classes in that module is given. Individual modules can be turned off
        by unchecking the checkbox left to their name. Please disallow some MEI modules by unchecking them.  
    </p>
    <p>
        It is fairly simple to (de-)select MEI modules, isn't it? However, by using this checkbox only, you get very little
        feedback on the consequences of your choices – the user interface isn't really telling you what you're taking out of 
        the schema with these selections. However, each module box also has a <em>customize</em>-button in its top-right corner. 
        When clicking this button, the list of modules in the center column is replaced by a list of all elements and attribute classes
        that are part of the current module. Please note that this is only possible for modules that you haven't excluded for the schema.
    </p>
    <p>    
        If you click to customize the <em>MEI.cmnOrnaments</em> module, you will see a list with
        the &lt;mordent&gt;, &lt;trill&gt;, and &lt;turn&gt; elements, and the <em>att.mordent.log</em>, <em>att.ornamentAccid</em>,
        <em>att.ornamPresent</em>, <em>att.trill.log</em>, and <em>att.turn.log</em> attribute classes. Again, you can unselect any 
        of those, depending on your specific needs. While on the last screen, you've been able to turn off modules in full, here you 
        can make selective choices, narrowing down MEI to your very needs. If, for whatever reason, you need a version of MEI that allows
        you to encode &lt;trill&gt;s, but does not support &lt;mordent&gt;s and &lt;turn&gt;s, you can easily turn off those two elements,
        but keep the <em>MEI.cmnOrnaments</em> module as such. Looking at "larger" modules like <em>MEI.cmn</em>, <em>MEI.header</em>, or
        <em>MEI.edittrans</em>, it is easy to envision more practical use cases for this selective exclusion of elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As with elements, it is possible to <strong>disallow attribute classes</strong> in this module overview. However, this requires 
        a good understanding of the available classes and their nesting. For most users (and use cases), it will be more practical to 
        do this from a slightly different perspective. On each element, there is a <em>set attributes</em>-button. If you click that button,
        the content of the main column is yet again replaced with different content. This time, you will find a listing of all 
        attributes available on that element. The layout of this listing follows the attribute classes that this element is a member of.
        Each attribute class has a checkbox that can be used to turn it off. If you unselect an attribute class, it will not only
        remove the attributes defined within that class, but will also suppress all other attribute classes inherited through the class
        hierarchy – including all attributes defined by those. For instance, if you uncheck the <em>att.basic</em> attribute class (which
        is available on every element in MEI through the <em>att.common</em> class), this will not only remove the <em>@xml:base</em> 
        attribute, but also the <em>att.id</em> class, and through this the <em>@xml:id</em> attribute. After doing this on any element
        of your choice, you should navigate to another element. You will notice there that the same attribute class is already turned 
        off: All those options are properly coordinated. This includes the attribute classes listed at the level of individual modules.   
    </p>
    <p>
        With the options to turn off <strong>modules</strong>, individual <strong>elements</strong>, and specific <strong>attribute 
            classes</strong>, it is already possible to restrict the MEI schema considerably, making it a better fit for the specific
        needs of any given project, and help that project to avoid inconsistency and other encoding problems. As the MEI ProfileDrafter 
        allows to start from multiple official MEI customizations, it is fairly simple to generate a custom version of MEI that further 
        restricts the MEI CMN profile (or any other cusotmization). In the next step of this tutorial, we will see how to make use of
        this customization.
