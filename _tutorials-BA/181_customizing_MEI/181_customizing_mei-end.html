        You have learned how to use the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI ProfileDrafter</a> for creating MEI Customizations
        through a graphical user interface. You have learned that this tool has limited scope, but already allows to restrict MEI considerably. 
        You have learned that the ODD markup generated by the tool is actually pretty simple, and can be done manually equally well. You learned how to
        use <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-att.combinable.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">@mode</a>s in 
        advanced ODD customizations, and how they allow more fine-grained control over the resulting schema. Along the way, you also learned how to compile
        an ODD customization into a RelaxNG file that can be used for validation, using the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/customization" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Customization Service</a>.

        Of course, there are other ways to compile ODD, there are additional concepts to keep in mind, and the fact that MEI uses an older version of
        ODD than the TEI (as described in the <a href="/tutorials/understanding-odd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">Understanding ODD</a> tutorial)
        may cause confusion along the way. Working with ODD is surely a bit odd, but it's definitely worth the effort, as it allows you to use a version of
        MEI that is very specific to your needs. This will help you to provide proper documentation, which will help others to better understand and use your
        data. So, writing ODD customizations is definitely a good investment in the sustainability of your research.

        A word of warning: This tutorial is pretty much work in progress, and may be organized differently after gathering feedback from a number of workshops.
