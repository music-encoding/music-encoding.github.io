        You have already learned how to use the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI ProfileDrafter</a>, 
        and you have used the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/customization" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Customization Service</a>
        to compile your own customization. You have downloaded an <code>.odd</code> file with that customization. We're assuming your customization 
        takes out some modules, elements, and attribute classes. Let's review how this manifests in the ODD customization
        file now. Please open it with any convenient XML Editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find a regular TEI file, with some disclaimers
        on top, and a <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> element that may serve as a starting point for providing proper documentation
        for your customization. You will certainly want to adjust the <code>&lt;respStmt&gt;</code> (responsibility statement) that is 
        usually somewhere around line 27 to claim responsibility. The interesting content starts at line 54 (the exact number may vary). 
        There, we have the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-schemaSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;schemaSpec&gt;</a>
        element, which starts our customization. Let's put aside the attributes specified here, and let's also ignore the
        <code>&lt;constraintSpec&gt;</code> element for now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What we see then is a list of <code>&lt;moduleRef&gt;</code> 
        (<a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-moduleRef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">module reference</a>)
        elements, each of which refering to an MEI module with it's <code>@key</code> attribute. Only those attributes that you haven't excluded 
        from the schema are listed here. Accordingly, it is very simple to exclude an MEI module from a customization manually: You just need to 
        delete the reference to it in you customization file. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On one or more <code>&lt;moduleRef&gt;</code>s, you should see an additional attribute <code>@except</code>. This attribute holds a 
        <em>list of elements</em> from the specified module, which are to be <em>excluded</em> from the customization. Basically, here you can selectively 
        take out individual elements, while keeping all others from the current module in your customization. ODD also supports the reverse approach of
        explicitly allowing elements from a module through the <code>@include</code> attribute. It is not allowed to combine both approaches, and 
        according to the TEI Guidelines, ODD processors are requested to raise an error message. The MEI ProfileDrafter will understand both approaches when
        uploading existing customizations, but will prefer <em>@except</em> over <em>@include</em> when exporting data. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, at the end of your ODD file there will be a list of <code>&lt;classSpec&gt;</code>
        (<a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-classSpec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">class specification</a>)
        elements with <code>@type="atts"</code>. They also use the <code>@ident</code> attribute to identify individual attribute classes. Please note that
        this element holds no reference to the module this attribute is defined in. Instead, and more importantly, it uses the <code>@mode</code> attribute 
        to specify what should be done to the original MEI sources, which are supposed to be modified by your customization. Here, the only value used will
        be <code>@mode="delete"</code> – the corresponding attribute classes will be deleted from your customization, making them unavailable in the resulting
        schema. Again, it is very simple to make such exclusions manually.  
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, there is very little that the MEI ProfileDrafter is actually doing in ODD – it is mostly a convenient user interface that 
        helps to illustrate the consequences of removing various components from the schema. For instance, it shows very clearly which attributes on 
        the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element will be unavailable when the <em>MEI.gestural</em> module is turned off. Technically, however, it is 
        doing only very simple things one could implement manually equally well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following step, we will introduce some more concepts for ODD customizations, paving the path for even more specific ODD customizations.
