        As soon as you have created a custom restricted version of MEI with the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI ProfileDrafter</a>, the next step
        is to prepare your first <em>MEI Customization</em> for validation – you need to compile it into a RelaxNG file. Whiel the
        ProfileDrafter will offer such a compiled version for direct download at some point, we will focus on a different compilation
        method which allows to make further manual changes the ODD customization file. In a professional project setup, you will also 
        want to version and document your ODD customization properly – both of which is out of scope for the MEI ProfileDrafter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please hit the <em>Download ODD</em>-button in the left column of the ProfileDrafter and save the offered file to any 
        convenient location. Now direct a new browser window to the 
        <a href="https://meigarage.edirom.de/customization" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Customization Service</a>
        that is part of the MEI Garage. Here, you need to select the MEI Source file your customization is based on. As the 
        ProfileDrafter is currently restricted to MEI v4.0.1, you can keep the default option in the Customization Service. The next 
        step is to select and upload your <em>Local Customization</em> file in the center column. Then, you need to keep the <em>Output</em>
        option set to <em>RelaxNG</em>. You can now hit the large <em>Process</em>-button in blue. After some server-side processing, 
        the label of that button will change to <em>Download</em>. As soon as that happens, you can click again to download the
        resulting <strong>RelaxNG</strong> file. Please make sure to rename the downloaded file to something meaningful and use
        the <code>.rng</code> extension. You now have a proper RelaxNG file compiled from your ODD Customization. This file may 
        be used to validate XML files against your custom profile of MEI. Congratulations – you have already made significant 
        progress in how to use MEI. A version specifically tailored for your needs is always preferable over a generic one-size-fits-all
        profile – which is obviously meant as starting point for more specific adjustments tailored around your needs.

        This tutorial could safely stop here. The real challenge is to <strong>identify your needs</strong> and to 
        <strong>model them accordingly</strong> anyway, but this is nothing that could be taught by an online tutorial. While getting
        the necessary experience for this will depend on time and interchange, you already have the technical skills to approach
        good models.

        However, with some additional adjustments to the ODD Customization, it is possible to exersize even better control over the 
        resulting schema, giving you very tight control over validation and thus helping to prevent data errors as much as possible. 
        Such adjustments are out of scope for the ProfileDrafter, and will therefore require manual adjustments to the ODD Customization.
        In the next step, we will analyze the structures that the ProfileDrafter uses to remove individual <em>modules</em>, <em>elements</em>,
        and <em>attribute classes</em> from MEI.
