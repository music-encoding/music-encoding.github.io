        That's it. You just need to write a bunch of files, and commit them to the MEI website, in the
        <a href="https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding.github.io/tree/main/_tutorials" target="_blank">tutorials</a>
        folder. Ideally, you will prepare the tutorial in your own branch, and then send a pull request to the MEI repository 
        and ask for reviews by some of the Technical Team.
        Of course, we're happy to assist you – just <a href="/community/community-contacts.html" target="_blank">contact</a> us.
        To get a headstart, you may want to copy an existing tutorial and modify that to your needs. The 
        <code>101_quickstart</code> tutorial should be a good starting point, as it is very simple, but still holds all relevant
        features.

        Thanks for reading all this. Thanks even more for considering to write a tutorial for MEI. Your input can definitely make
        a difference. Even though you may not be sure if you're sufficiently familiar with MEI, you can surely share some 
        of your insights with others. Even if you just have an idea for what should be covered by tutorial, please step up, so 
        that maybe we can build it together – as a community, for the community.
