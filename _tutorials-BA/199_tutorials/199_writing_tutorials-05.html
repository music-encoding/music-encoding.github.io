        Obviously, proper input validation is crucial for an effective and sustained learning success.
        Because our website is based on Jekyll, however, we have to rely on client-side validation 
        (relying on an external service for validation only is probably not reliable enough, so we decided
        against that approach). To this date, client-side validation (= Javascript) doesn't offer proper
        support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RelaxNG" target="_blank">RelaxNG</a>, the schema language 
        ultimately used to validate MEI instances in real projects. For this reason, we need to use the
        XPath-based approach mentioned earlier.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>"xpaths"</code> property of the current step holds an array of rules to which the user's encoding must
        conform in order to complete that step. These rules are specified as JSON objects with three properties:   
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">{
    "rule":"//mei:note/@pname = 'g'",
    "renderanyway":true,
    "hint":"You need a @pname attribute, with a value of g."
}</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>"rule"</code> property holds an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath" target="_blank">XPath 1</a>
        expression, which must resolve to a boolean statement: it has to be 
        either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. The <code>"renderanyway"</code>
        is used to decide if the current editor can be rendered by Verovio 
        even if the XPath isn't matched. The content of <code>"hint"</code>
        is supposed to assist the user to reach the correct encoding. Only
        the first failing XPath will be displayed at a time, guiding the 
        user step by step through the different requirements. However, not
        every step needs a hint – sometimes it's better to let the user 
        explore a bit on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
        For validation, the current user input will be inserted between the 
        <code>&lt;?snippet-start?&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;?snippet-end?&gt;</code>
        markers in the current XML file, and then the XPath rules will be 
        checked against that complete file. As soon as one of these rules fails
        (i.e. returns <i>false</i>), the corresponding <code>"hint"</code> 
        will be displayed. When all rules return <i>true</i>, the "continue" 
        button will be enabled and the user may proceed to the next step.
