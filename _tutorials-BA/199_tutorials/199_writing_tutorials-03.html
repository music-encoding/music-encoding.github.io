        In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> file, the contents of a tutorial are 
        coordinated. It has an object with a number of properties. Let's have a look at (a simplified version of)
        this current tutorial:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">{
  "steps": [
    {
        "label":"Welcome",
        "descFile": "writingTutorials-01.html"
    },
    {
        "label":"Website Setup",
        "descFile": "writingTutorials-02.html"
    },
    
    <span class="text-gray"><i>… more steps to be added here …</i></span>
    
  ],
  "end":"writingTutorials-end.html",
  "resp":[
    {
        "name":"Johannes Kepper",
        "affiliation":"Beethovens Werkstatt | Universität Paderborn"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
    <label>tutorials.json</label>
    <p>
        There are three important properties in here. The first one, <code>"steps"</code> is used to describe the different steps in 
        a tutorial. We'll come back to that in a second. The next one, <code>"end"</code>, specifies a file in which the final page of a 
        tutorial is provided. Finally, there is <code>"resp"</code>. In this array, you're supposed to put in your name
        and affiliation. That way, we're not only trying to identify a contact person if questions arise, but also to give
        you some public recognition for the work you're doing on MEI. In case you've worked on a tutorial with a group of 
        people, you may of course enter all of them. So why not ask some of your students to work on these tutorials?
    </p>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <p>
        Back to the steps property. This is an array of objects, each describing one step of a tutorial. The only property
        that is definitely required is <code>"descFile"</code>. Here, you need to provide the name of an HTML file containing the instructions 
        for this step. Basically, it's what you currently read. That file is not a full HTML file; it should start with a 
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> root element and contains simple HTML.
        The next property, <code>"label"</code>, is optional. If you don't provide it, the step will be labelled according to its
        position (i.e. "Step 3" or similar).
    </p>
    <p>
        Obviously, a tutorial is not supposed to be pure text only (that would hardly justify this whole setup…). Sometimes, 
        you may want the user to actually encode things. Let's have a look at the definition of such a "step":
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">{
    <span class="text-gray">"label":"A Sample Step",</span>
    <span class="text-gray">"descFile": "step-instructions.html",</span>
    "xmlFile": "encoding.xml",
    "xpaths": [
        {
            "rule":"count(//mei:note) = 1",
            "renderanyway":false
        },
        {
            "rule":"//mei:note/@pname = 'g'",
            "renderanyway":true,
            "hint":"You need a @pname attribute, with a value of g."
        }
    ],
    "editorLines":3,
    "prefillFile":"prefill.xml"
}</pre>
    <label>Definition of a tutorial step that includes an editor component, to be inserted in the "steps" array of tutorials.json </label>
    <p>
        The two properties we already know are in gray, we don't need to go back to them. If a step contains both an 
        <code>"xmlFile"</code> and an <code>"xpaths"</code> property, an editor will be displayed. At the same time,
        the "Continue"-button on the lower right will go away. In order to proceed, the user now has to follow your 
        instructions and enter the MEI code in the editor. In order to decide if the user has succeeded or not, you 
        need to provide a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath" target="_blank">XPath</a> rules. The XPath itself is
        stored in a <code>"rule"</code> property. It has to return a boolean value, i.e. <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. 
        If you want to guide the user, you may provide a <code>"hint"</code> property. If the editor's content doesn't
        match an XPath rule, it's hint will be rendered as a warning box below the editor. XPath rules are checked in 
        order, and further checking is stopped on every falsy rule. If all rules are matched, the tutorial will 
        automatically continue to the next step. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>"renderanyway"</code> property of an XPath rule is useful when you want the user to "play around" with
        the encoding. Normally, the users input is rendered only when all XPath rules are matched. However, you could
        ask the user to try out different pitches, saying that the tour continues when a specific pitch is entered. 
        Then, you may set <code>"renderanyway"</code> to <code>true</code>, and Verovio will try it's best in rendering
        the current user input. This behaviour is implemented in the second XPath rule above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>"xmlfile"</code> property specifies a file that serves as context for the editor. In the next step
        of this tutorial, we'll explain this in greater detail. There are two more properties that might be useful. 
        With the <code>"editorLines"</code> property, you can specify the height of the editor window. If you don't 
        provide it, a default height of <i>5</i> lines will be assumed. Finally, you can prefill the editor at the beginning
        of a step with the contents of a file you specify with the <code>"prefillFile"</code> property. If you don't provide 
        that, the editor will keep the input the user has entered in the previous step (or it will be empty on the first one).
