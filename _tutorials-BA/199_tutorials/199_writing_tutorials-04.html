        When doing a tutorial by yourself, you may have wondered how Verovio is able to render the user's MEI, 
        even though not a complete MEI file is entered by the user. This is achieved by the <code>"xmlFile"</code>
        property of a tutorial step introduced on the last page. This property references a complete MEI file,
        which provides the context that needs to go "around" the user's input for correct rendering. Let's look at
        a simple example: 
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">&lt;mei xmlns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei"&gt;
    &lt;meiHead&gt;
        &lt;fileDesc&gt;
            &lt;titleStmt&gt;
                &lt;title/&gt;
            &lt;/titleStmt&gt;
            &lt;pubStmt/&gt;
        &lt;/fileDesc&gt;
    &lt;/meiHead&gt;
    &lt;music&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;mdiv&gt;
                &lt;score&gt;
                    &lt;scoreDef&gt;
                        &lt;staffGrp&gt;
                            &lt;staffDef clef.shape="G" clef.line="2" n="1" lines="5"/&gt;
                        &lt;/staffGrp&gt;
                    &lt;/scoreDef&gt;
                    &lt;section&gt;
                        &lt;measure&gt;
                            &lt;staff n="1"&gt;
                                &lt;layer&gt;
                                    <span class="text-error">&lt;?snippet-start?&gt;</span>
                                    &lt;note pname="c" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;
                                    <span class="text-error">&lt;?snippet-end?&gt;</span>
                                &lt;/layer&gt;
                            &lt;/staff&gt;
                        &lt;/measure&gt;
                    &lt;/section&gt;
                &lt;/score&gt;
            &lt;/mdiv&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/music&gt;
&lt;/mei&gt;</pre>
    <label>A simple MEI file, to be used as context for the user input.</label>
    <p>
        This is just a regular MEI file, but it contains two important <i>processing instructions</i>
        (marked in red). The content of this file is read into memory. Whenever the user input in the editor
        is well-formed XML, it is inserted <i>between</i> the two processing instructions, and the complete
        file (now including the user input) is validated and (if applicable) sent to Verovio for rendering. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What is stored between the two <i>processing instructions</i> is intended to serve as sample solution. 
        That functionality isn't implemented yet, but will be added soon. It is already possible to download 
        the complete file (including the context), so that users may use them for future reference or as model 
        for their own work.
