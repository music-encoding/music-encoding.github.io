        Like the rest of our website, all tutorials are served directly from a 
        <a href="https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. This has 
        both benefits and drawbacks. A tremendous benefit is that creating a new tutorial is as easy as 
        committing a folder to the repository (we'll explain that later, no worries). The biggest drawbacks are that
        the interactivity required for a tutorial isn't very well supported by that technical setup, and that we 
        cannot really validate against the MEI Schema. Both aspects have been addressed by us, and we hope that
        our solutions balance well between the user's need for guidance and the effort that needs to go into the 
        preparation of a tutorial. We'll come back to that later as well.

        Now <b>let's get started</b>. Our pages are build and served by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. 
        For our tutorials, this means we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> file
        with the details about our tutorial that the surrounding website needs to know to embed it properly.
        Let's have a look at the Markdown file for this very tutorial:
    </p>
    <pre class="codeblock">---
layout: tutorials
type: tutorial
name: "Writing Tutorials"
fullname: "An Introduction to writing MEI tutorials"
data: "tutorials.json"
---</pre>
    <label>tutorials.md (Markdown file)</label>
    <p>While the first two lines, <code>layout: tutorials</code> and <code>type: tutorial</code> always need to stay 
        like this, the following two lines may change. What you write in here get's displayed in the list of tutorials, 
        for instance. Please note that the very first and last line, each holding three dashes, must stay like this for
        the tutorial to function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I said before, we do have to work around the limitations of our technical setup to some degree. For that
        reason, we're referencing a file called <code>tutorials.json</code>, which lives in the same folder. The name
        of the file doesn't matter, as long as it can be found in the same folder as the Markdown file. Let's move on 
        to the contents of this JSON file.
