# Technical team

The Technical Team consists of interested developers and two Board-appointed Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs act as administrative chairs of the Technical Team, e.g., calling meetings and coordinating development efforts. They also have administrative privileges for the MEI repositories. The MEI Technical Team holds regular virtual and in-person meetings, maintains the MEI repository on GitHub ([https://github.com/music-encoding](https://github.com/music-encoding)), prepares new releases of MEI by reviewing and implementing revisions and features requested by the community, and supports the wider MEI community with their technical expertise.

## MEI ODD meetings

MEI ODD Fridays and ODD Thursdays are a monthly video conference call with anyone interested in the development of MEI. During these calls, we discuss open pull requests with additions to and revisions of both the MEI Schema and Guidelines. There are two requirements for accepting changes:

* There have to be matching proposals for both the Schema and the Guidelines (i.e., changes without proper documentation won't get accepted, but may collect feedback),
* there needs to be wide acceptance for these changes at the meetings and in the corresponding PRs.

If a proposal doesn't match these two criteria, it will be postponed and should be revised for the next ODD meeting.

We aim to organize, schedule, and document these meetings with the help of a GitHub dashboard: https://github.com/orgs/music-encoding/projects/2. We also plan to send out timely reminders in advance of these meetings. The intention is to increase both comprehensibility and transparency of the MEI development workflow, and make it more accessible and inviting to newcomers.

The schedule for these developer workshops is the _last Friday of every odd month_, and _last Thursday of every even month_, at 1pm UTC (in summer) resp. 2pm UTC (in winter). Calls are scheduled for:
