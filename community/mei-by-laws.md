# MEI By-laws

## 1 Preamble

The name of this organisation is ‘Music Encoding Initiative’ (hereafter abbreviated ‘MEI’).

## 2 Purpose

The purpose of MEI is to create, promote, and diffuse a semantically rich model for music notation that:

* accommodates the encoding of the intellectual and physical characteristics of music notation documents, primarily focusing on but not being limited to Common Western Music Notation (CWMN);
* is designed by the scholarly community for scholarly uses, but does not exclude other uses;
* provides for the common functions of traditional facsimile, critical, and performance editions;
* has a modular structure that permits use dependent on the goals of scholars; and
* is based on open standards and is platform-independent;
* permits the development of comprehensive and permanent international archives of notated music as a basis for editions, analysis, performances, and other forms of research.

## 3 Community Membership

Membership in MEI is open to anyone with an interest in supporting the goals and purpose of MEI.

### 3.1 Types of Membership

There are two types of membership in MEI: personal and institutional. Both types of members are equally eligible for such membership benefits as the Board may determine from time to time. No member is entitled to a refund of any dues or other charges or assessments upon resignation or termination of membership.

#### 3.1.1 Personal Membership

Only private individuals may obtain personal membership in MEI. Personal membership is conferred by subscription to the MEI mailing list ([MEI-L](https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html)). All personal members may vote, nominate members for office, stand for office, and otherwise benefit from the activities of MEI.

#### 3.1.2 Institutional Membership

Institutional Membership in MEI is available for any form of organization, project or company. Any of the above wishing to become an Institutional Member of MEI may apply by submitting an application, in a form prescribed by the Board, to any elected member of the Board.

There are three levels of Institutional Membership: An institution that sponsors MEI with an annual contribution of $500, $2000, or $5000 or more will be designated a ‘regular’, ‘patron’, or ‘sustaining’ MEI Institutional Member, respectively. Other forms of in-kind commitment with the same value as the annual fees above, such as staff time or administrative support, may substitute for monetary contributions.

The logos of sponsoring organizations will appear on publications by the [MEI Board](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html) (e.g. conference proceedings, guidelines) and on [http://www.music-encoding.org](http://www.music-encoding.org). While the logos of sustaining Institutional Members will appear on title pages and on the welcome page of the website, those of patron and regular Institutional Members will appear in a dedicated section.

All Institutional members in good standing have the right to display the MEI logo on any MEI-related publications or products they create or distribute that conform to the license under which MEI is distributed.

### 3.2 Termination

The [Board](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html) may terminate an individual or institutional membership in MEI upon good-faith finding of (a) misconduct by such member reflecting discredit upon MEI or (b) violation of these By-laws.

### 3.3 Resignation

Any member may resign from MEI. 

Resignation of a Personal Membership is effective upon unsubscribing from MEI-L.

Resignation of an Institutional Membership is effective upon the Board’s receipt of a formal (physical or electronic) notice of resignation.

## 4 Finances

Financial revenue of MEI  (generated through membership fees, donations, grants, or other means) will be administered by the Board.

## 5 Board

The property and business of MEI are managed by the [Board](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html). The broad role of the Board is to promote the development of MEI; oversee the activities of the [MEI Technical Team](https://music-encoding.org/community/technical-team.html); guide the development of the MEI conceptual model, [Guidelines](https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/), and schemata; and act as a contact point for MEI-related activities.

The Board is self-organizing; that is, there will be no formal regulations on how the responsibilities above are to be divided amongst its members.

## 7 Host Institutions

Any institution interested in promoting the goals and purpose of MEI may apply to the Board to become a Host Institution of MEI. The form of the application will be set by the Board. The Board is responsible for reviewing the application in a timely fashion and granting or withholding official recognition of the host institution.

### 7.1 Rights & Duties

Host Institutions will be allowed to designate a representative of their organization as a regular member of the MEI Board. The logos of Host Institutions will appear on the first page of publications by the MEI Board (e.g. conference proceedings, guidelines) and on the welcome page of [http://www.music-encoding.org](http://www.music-encoding.org). The Host Institution will be allowed to advertise themselves as a MEI Host Institution. Other rights and duties both of MEI and a Host Institution are subject to individual agreements between the institution and the Board. These agreements shall be fixed in written form. Example agreements may include: provision of technical or administrative support of MEI through the Host Institution, installing an MEI-related working group at the Host Institution, etc.

## 8 Interest Groups

An Interest Group (henceforth ‘IG’) is composed of any number of members of the MEI community with an interest in a certain music encoding topic or problem. The topic of interest should be reflected in the group’s name. Individual membership in multiple groups is allowed.

In order to form a new IG, a proposal shall be made to the Board, containing the group’s name, goals, and a list of founding members. The Board is responsible for reviewing the application in a timely fashion and granting or withholding official recognition to the new group.

Each interest group must:

* select an administrative chair
* produce regular activity reports (annual reports due 1 month prior to the annual Board meeting)

A single person may not be administrative chair of multiple IGs. The IG’s administrative chair takes responsibility for acting as contact person for the IG, ensuring regular activity, submitting reports to the Board, and organizing the group’s work, e.g. calling for meetings and coordinating development efforts.

Each IG will be self-organizing; that is, there will be no formal regulations on how any other responsibilities are to be divided amongst its members. In addition, the IG may establish decision-making processes as necessary; however, it should rely on consensus rather than majority rule whenever possible.

### 8.1 Interest Group privileges

All Interest Groups will be listed on the MEI-website and are eligible to other benefits as the Board may determine from time to time.

## 9 Conference & Members Meeting

A regular conference is deemed essential for building and maintaining relationships within the MEI community. For the time being, this conference will also host an official MEI Members Meeting. The location of conferences will be decided by the Board in a timely manner before the event. The Board will call for conference host applications prior to the decision. Questions regarding the application as conference organizer, program submissions, the choice of the program committee of the conference, etc. should be made as transparent as possible for potential conference organizers.

## 10 Amendments

Changes to these by-laws become proposed amendments with a simple majority of the complete Board membership. Proposed amendments will be published on the MEI mailing list (MEI-L) and the MEI website. After a minimum 10-day comment period, the Board will discuss comments on the proposed amendments received from the MEI membership and incorporate changes agreed to by a simple majority of the Board. The agreed upon version of the amended by-laws will be presented to the MEI membership for voting over a minimum 7-day period. The amended version of the by-laws must pass with a two-thirds (2/3) majority of votes in order to become effective.
