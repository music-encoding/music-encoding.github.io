# 2020 Board Election Candidates

Candidates for the MEI Elections are invited to send along a brief CV and Candidate Statement. These are provided below, ordered alphabetically by surname.


## Iacopo Cividini

#### CV

The focus of my activities in the last 15 years is the field of Born Digital Scholarly Editions. After a PhD on Dvorak’s Solo Concertos at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, I worked at four DH projects: a database of musicians ([Bayerisches Musiker-Lexikon Online](https://www.bmlo.lmu.de/)), a database of sources ([Mozart Libretti – Online Catalog](https://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/libretti-catalog/)), a TEI-based scholarly text edition ([Mozart Libretti – Online Edition](https://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/libretti-edition/)) and a MEI-based scholarly music edition ([Digital Interactive Mozart Edition](https://dme.mozarteum.at/movi/en)). Within the last project, I actually coordinate the digital publication of the reference texts and the development of workflows for the encoding in MEI. We have so far encoded and published more than 30 works by Mozart in almost all music genres: piano, chamber, orchestral, opera and church music.

#### Statement

My approach to MEI is a pragmatic one, keeping always in mind the online publication of reliable results in a user-friendly rendering. Following the principle “learning by doing”, I would put my focus in the board on making MEI even more practicable for the online publication of editions by the community and within the different projects:

1. More and more extensive examples in the Guidelines
2. Development of an MEI Database of Best Practices (collecting the best practices from actual projects including the Digital Interactive Mozart Edition)
3. Extension of the encoding possibilities for the critical documentation of scholarly editions (e.g. the encoding of editorial interventions)
4. Small corrections of the “New Header” in MEI 4.0 (e.g. source classification and source description).

I would be honoured to follow these targets for the community in the MEI Board!


## Stefan Münnich

#### CV

After studying musicology and communication science at the Technische Universität Berlin, where I graduated in 2011 with a MA thesis on cantional settings in Heinrich Schütz's _Becker-Psalter_, I worked for the edition project _Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Sämtliche Briefe_ at the University of Leipzig between 2012 and 2015 (co-editor of vols. 9 & 12). Since October 2015 I have been a research associate of the Anton Webern Gesamtausgabe at the University of Basel, where I finished my PhD thesis on music notation and code by the end of 2019.


#### Statement

It is a great honour to be nominated for the MEI Board. I have always experienced the MEI community as a welcoming, open-minded and inclusive community, characterised by the rich experience, expertise and diversity of the people involved and committed in it. Serving on the Board, I would be delighted to continue to contribute to this living vision and to support more people in their diverse needs, interest and commitment within the MEI community, but also in building bridges to other communities.


## Laurent Pugin

#### CV

I completed my dissertation at Geneva University on optical music recognition and was then Postdoctoral Research Fellow at McGill University. Since 2009, I am Co-Director of the RISM Office in Bern, and secretary of the Board of Directors of the RISM since 2013. I am also a Co-PI for the SIMSSA research project based at McGill. In 2019, I completed a Habilitation (privat docent) in Musicology and Digital Humanities at the University of Bern where I continue to teach regularly.


#### Statement

I would be honoured to continue serving on the MEI Board. My work on the development of the Verovio library and as part of the RISM project has given me insights into the development of MEI tools which I feel are beneficial to the MEI community as a whole. I will continue to devote time to this, as I have done for many years, thanks to the support I receive to do so from my institution, the RISM Office in Bern.


## Klaus Rettinghaus

#### CV

Klaus holds degrees in physics (diploma) and musicology (PhD). He’s been singing for most of his life, spending much of that time in choirs. Several times he had sung and acted on stage, and even conducted here and there. He gives lectures in music history at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Leipzig.

For nine years Klaus worked at the Leipzig Bach Archive and was involved in the development of Bach digital. Now he is at Enote to improve digital sheet music. He is a member of the technical team at MEI as well as several interest groups. He is also deputy speaker of the Digital Musicology Section of the German Musicological Society.

#### Statement

I am honored to have been nominated as a member of the MEI Board. It’s a privilege to be part of this great community and my pleasure to work on and with MEI. Particularly interested in MEI and music engraving I invented MEILER (https://github.com/rettinghaus/MEILER) and take active part in the development of Verovio, SibMEI, and other tools built around MEI. Being a board member, I hope to be able to pour even more love and time into MEI.


## Kristina Richts-Matthaei

#### CV

I studied Library and Information Science at the University of Applied Sciences Leipzig (Diploma 2006) and the University of Applied Sciences Cologne (Master 2013) as well as Musicology and Literary Studies at the University of Paderborn (Master 2011). In February 2018 I received my doctorate in Musicology with a thesis on Robert Schumann's Three Works Unit op. 79, op. 98a and op. 98b.
Since 2011 I am employed at the University of Paderborn and since then MEI plays a major role in my daily work, especially the field of MEI metadata. Currently I am working as a research assistant in the [Detmold Court Theater Project](https://hoftheater-detmold.de/), whose goal is to develop an MEI- and TEI-based data model for the contextual deep indexing of music collections, and in the Culture Coordination Office of [NFDI4Culture](https://nfdi4culture.de/), which is the Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage within the National Research Data Infrastructure of Germany. Since its foundation I am administrative Co-Chair of the MEI Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group and represent MEI on various other committees such as [Musiconn](https://www.musiconn.de/) or the Special Working Group Music, which is currently being established by the Standardization Committee of the German National Library.

#### Statement

I am very pleased to have been nominated again for an MEI Board candidacy. If I were given the opportunity to continue my work on the MEI Board, it would be a pleasure for me to continue to place my dual expertise in musicology and information science at the service of MEI, and in particular to contribute to standardization and the development of best practice recommendations, which are urgently needed in research projects. Another point that is very important to me and which I am happy to support is to bring MEI data into libraries on a long-term basis and to help create a stable basis for this.
