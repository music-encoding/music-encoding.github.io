    - Specific benefits were identified per sponsor level, as well as placement of logos on MEI publications

    - By-law text in section 3.1.2 has been drafted to reflect updated language and will be shared with the Board for final review
    - Once approved, final versions will be published on the MEI website and shared on MEI-list 

- MEC proceedings (Anna P.)
    - Currently using Knowledge Commons to publish MEC Proceedings, but finding that the UI is cumbersome to use
