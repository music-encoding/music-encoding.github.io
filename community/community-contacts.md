# Mailing list

The official MEI mailing list, MEI-L, is used to inform the community about upcoming events, discuss possible improvements for MEI, evaluate encoding strategies and models, and get support from the full community. 

The list is open to anyone for subscription, and everyone is welcome to join MEI-L by subscribing to: [https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-l](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-l). 

Also, the archives of the list are open to the public and can be browsed online: [https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/pipermail/mei-l/](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/pipermail/mei-l/).

Such e-mail addresses will receive deactivation warnings for a number of weeks before being automatically unsubscribed from the list if no action is taken by the subscriber.

# Knowledge Commons: MEI Group

The Music Encoding Initiative group in the Knowledge Commons (previously called Humanities Commons) is devoted to a discussion of topics related to music encoding, and is an extension of the Music Encoding Initiative channels on MEI-L and website. The Knowledge Commons is a network for people working in the humanities. Connect with other scholars and their scholarship, and increase the impact of your work by sharing it in the repository. The MEI Group at the Knowledge Commons can be accessed at [https://hcommons.org/groups/music-encoding-initiative/](https://hcommons.org/groups/music-encoding-initiative/).
