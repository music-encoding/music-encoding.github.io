@inproceedings{Bohl_2016,
 abstract = {Tracing back theoretical discussion and writing about the nature of music, leads as far as classical antiquity. Pythagoras (of Samos) laid out the mathematical foundations of musical harmony -- and hence constituted the tradition of more than 2.500 years that we can look upon today. Ever since, knowledge on music and its theory has been accompanied by the knowledge about its history. No matter the century that you pick, the basic pythagorean derivation of musical harmony or some variant of the "legend of the hammer strokes" is omnipresent. This tradition produced a huge corpus of individual treatises that provide rules for composing  music. Different eras and genres called for different rules and not seldom, personal preference and self-display were motors to pen down a certain theory of music. Moreover, notorious treatises got transcribed, reproduced me-chanically or borrowed from and -- as consciousness of authorship and copyright had yet to prosper -- partly incorporated into other treatises, without referencing the original author. Beside the amount of pages to grasp in various languages, the above mentioned circumstances make it es-pecially hard for the uninitiated to know which rule to find where or even to fathom the multiple interrelations between these treatises},

@inproceedings{Diet_2016,
 abstract = {The RISM-OPAC (http://opac.rism.info) is a free online catalogue that provides access to the data of the RISM series A II (music manuscripts between 1600 and 1800). It has been developed by the Bavarian State Library in cooperation with RISM and the State Library of Berlin and was launched in June 2010. In March 2011, a new version of the RISM-OPAC has been released that includes a searching possibility in the music incipits of the RISM data. Most of the 850.000 data records (as of September 2013) contain one or several music incipits that describe the beginning of instrumental or vocal parts of the music manuscripts using the Plaine{\&}Easie code. This paper describes how the music incipits are encoded in Plaine{\&}Easie and how the searching for music incipits is done in the RISM-OPAC. Furthermore, the rendering of an incipit encoded in Plaine{\&}Easie in a graphical image will be covered. When a RISM-record is displayed the user will not see the Plaine{\&}Easie code but the corresponding graphical form using the common western music notation. Finally, the current developments for the next version of the RISM-OPAC will be explained that include among others an improved user interface for searching in the music incipits and the conversion of the data records of the RISM series A/II into RDF in order to publish them as linked open data.},

@inproceedings{Richts_2016,
 abstract = {The Music Encoding Initiative's (MEI) XML schema recommendation not only supports detailed encodings of music notation; it also accommodates comprehensive metadata in the file header. The attempt to utilize the header for cataloguing projects has proved the need to distinguish different levels of description: Some meta-data relate to the musical work in general, some only to a certain version, or to a specific musical source, for instance. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, which was developed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), was explicitly conceived to provide a concept for this distinction within bibliographic records in general. An effort has been made within the MEI community to implement the so-called FRBR Group 1 entities (work, expression, manifestation, and item) and relationships in the MEI header. The paper gives an introduction to the FRBR implementation in MEI and demonstrates how relatively com-plex source situations can be modeled with it. Some limitations and problems are discussed.},

The approach relates closely to the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and to psychological coding theories of perceptual organisation. A sketch of a model of musical learning based on this approach is given and it is shown how the model accounts in principle for differences between individuals in how pieces of music are understood. The approach is implemented in a greedy compression algorithm, called COSIATEC, which partitions a point-set into the covered sets of translational equivalence classes of maximal translatable patterns. The analyses generated by COSIATEC on five fugues by J. S. Bach are presented and discussed. These analyses demonstrate the potential of the approach for automatically discovering musical patterns of thematic and structural importance.},

 abstract = {\textit{Plaine and Easie Code} is being used as the format for encoding musical content in the RISM catalogue. In this paper we propose an attributed grammar that formally specifies it. The grammar specification is written using a EBNF notation and is accompanied by syntax diagrams and some examples that show how it parses a valid input. With the formalization of the \textit{Plaine and Easie Code}, it is easier to create translators to other formats, analyze possible extensions, and avoid syntactic misunderstandings in the encoding process. The proposed grammar has been successfully used to decode more than one million incipits from the RISM catalogue in an automatic way. In the near future, we are planning to propose some extensions to the PAEC code and specify translation semantic actions associated to the grammar productions in order to convert from PAEC to the MEI format.},

@inproceedings{Hild_2016,
 abstract = {This essay describes the development process and encoding scheme of mono:di, the MEI-based, music-notation software program of \textit{Corpus monodicum}. \textit{Corpus monodicum} is a scholarly edition of the Latin-texted, medieval monophonic repertories -- both sacred and secular -- that form the historical foundation of European music, but have thus far been under-represented in musicological scholarship. The editorial project is spon-sored by the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, as part of the Akademienprogramm der Union der deutschen Akademien der Wissenschaften; it is housed at the Institut f{\"u}r Musikforschung, Universit{\"a}t W{\"u}rzburg.
    Mono:di was developed in conjunction with the music typesetting firm notengrafik berlin in order to facilitate the production of \textit{Corpus monodicum}'s publications, which will include both a series of 25 printed volumes and a digital edition (CM digital). Mono:di offers the project's editors a means of creating digital transcriptions in a direct and efficient way. The software also allows for an unproblematic transfer of editorial material to the typesetters who produce the analogue editions. Moreover, mono:di allows the same encoded material to serve as the basis both for the printed volumes and for the digital edition. This paper examines the editorial practices that shaped mono:di's development and the specific adaptations that were made to the MEI neumes module in mono:di's encoding scheme.},

@inproceedings{Pugin_2016,
 abstract = {The Music Encoding Initiative defines the specifications of encoding music in XML format. While MEI is extremely powerful and promising, very few tools exist for rendering it directly into graphical music notation. Most of the solutions currently used require an intermediate step to convert it into a format that can then be processed by one existing music typesetter. This approach has the disadvantage of being complex, often slow, and needing to rely on other tools for the task, whilst losing some of MEI's features in the conversion process. Verovio is an attempt to solve this issue: it is a portable, small and fast library that is capable of interpreting MEI directly to SVG music output, without intermediate steps. Its development focuses on compatibility with the MEI specification and also on making portable code that is easily employed in different environments, from rendering of small-scale incipit to rendering long multi-page scores. The paper presents some use-case scenarios for the Verovio library.},

@inproceedings{Bemman_2016,
 abstract = {In recent years, a significant body of research has focused on developing algorithms for computing analyses of musical works automatically from encodings of these works' surfaces [3,4,7,10,11]. The quality of the output of such analysis algorithms is typically evaluated by comparing it with a "ground truth" analysis of the same music produced by a human expert (see, in particular, [5]).

 In this paper, we explore the problem of generating an encoding of the musical surface of a work automatically from a systematic encoding of an analysis. The ability to do this depends on one having an effective (i.e., computable), correct and complete description of some aspect of the structure of the music. Generating the surface structure of a piece from an analysis in this manner serves as a proof of the analysis' correctness, effectiveness and completeness.

 We present a reductive analysis of \textit{Sheer Pluck} (1984), a twelve-tone composition for guitar by Milton Babbitt (1916--2011). This analysis focuses on the all-partition array structure on which the piece is based. Having presented this analysis, we formalize some constraints on the structure of the piece and explore some computational difficulties in automating the generation of the all-partition array structure},

In this method, a comment list is compiled, consisting of variant readings and editorial emendations. This list is maintained by inserting the comments into a document as the changes are made. Since the comments are not input sequentially, with regard to position, but in arbitrary order, this list must be sorted by copy/pasting the rows into place -- an error-prone and time-consuming process. Scholars who produce critical editions typically use off -the-shelf music notation software such as Sibelius or Finale. It was hypothesized that it would be possible to develop a Sibelius plug-in, written in Manuscript 6, that would improve the critical editing work fl ow, but it was found that the capabilities of this scripting language were insufficient. Instead, a 3-part system was designed and built, consisting of a Sibelius plug-in, a cross-platform application, called CriticalEd, and a REST-based solution, which handles data storage/retrieval. A prototype has been tested at the Danish Centre for Music Publication, and the results suggest that the system could greatly improve the efficiency of the critical editing work flow.},

 abstract = {The \textit{Digital Mozart Edition} (DME) has as its goal the digital presentation of documents and texts related to Mozart's life and oeuvre. The most challenging project within the DME is the digital edition of Mozart's music which is currently being developed. It will eventually make the complete compositional output of Mozart available to the public in critical, MEI based editions. The DME already hosts the \textit{NMA Online}, the representation in digital images of the \textit{Neue Mozart Ausgabe} (NMA) print edition, originally published between 1954 and 2007. While on the one hand, the DME seeks to transform the authoritative musical text of the NMA into digital format, the DME also intends to broaden the philological concept by the publication of new and alternative editions based on individual sources. At the present state of the project, several challenges have been identified, some connected to the publication history and the availability of sources used by the NMA. Others are related to the representation of the \textit{Kritische Berichte} of the NMA within the DME. The paper reports on the development of the conceptual as well as practical model of the DME music edition.},

Repurposing data collected over the last three decades in Scribe music encoding software required a bespoke MEI module, which we have called NeoScribe. The Scribe project has benefited from the long-term investigation and implementation of methods for the efficient encoding of late medieval music notation. With Scribe, users are able to represent every meaningful scribal mark on the written page, something that is not currently possible in the current MEI Chant and Mensural modules. In converting Scribe data to a MEI-compliant XML, we recognised the need to retain Scribe's nuance-rich encoding of medieval musical notation. For zero dataloss, new elements and data types were added to MEI for encoding late medieval chant and mensural notation. We demonstrate some of NeoScribe's enhanced features for encoding 14th-century repertoires. We conclude by discussing some of the benefits of revising the MEI Chant and Mensural modules for projects investigating music from before c.1500.},

 abstract = {This paper stems from the project of redevelopment of the \textit{Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum} (TML), the online searchable archive of early music treatises in Latin. Over 25 years after the project's inception, work is in progress to enrich the large corpus of plain-text files by encoding them with TEI, to improve the resource's fruition and the discoverability of the text. Over that background, a quite more difficult challenge emerges: to make also discoverable the large quantity of notated examples found interleaved with the verbal text of the treatises. It was not in the original intent to make music notation systematically searchable, but attempts were made to capture some facets of mensura notation through a code specifically designed for the project. The aim of this paper is both to discuss these earlier encoding attempts, with their shortcomings, and to propose our customization of MEI as a possible starting point to expand the current specifications. This is proving useful in the present state of the project: more work will be necessary to take care of other mensural features and flavors, and of course of chant and non-mensural notations, but MEI is proving apt to the job. The TML provides an ideal benchmark for developing a more specialized model of markup that will be useful for many other scholarly purposes.

The notation, named the Kassel-Wolfenb{\"u}ttel Tablature System (KWTS) by Marc Lewon, combines a quasi- mensural notation, which closely resembles the upper voice of organ tablature, and an alphabetic notation, parallel to organ tablature. Because of its connections to both tablature and mensural notations, in order to encode KWTS, one must combine the encoding systems for both tablature and mensural notation. In this paper, I examine some of the problems inherent in encoding KWTS; suggest possible solutions; and define a musicological application for the project. As the earliest lute-specific notation, KWTS contains valuable information on the changing lute performance practices of the mid-fifteenth century, despite the sources' brevity. Developing an encoding system for this notation will enable further exploration of fifteenth-century lute repertoire, including that prior to lute-specific notation.},

Although many of the chants follow the standard, expected forms, some items are difficult to classify. For example, certain melodies do not conform to the standard modes and some chants are unique in their usage for a particular day or service within the liturgical year. Although it is easy to create new classification tags, the prudent database manager exercises caution, as the modern need to categorize does not always conform to medieval custom. By focusing on chants from Holy Week including the \textit{Exsultet}, \textit{Improperia} and \textit{Trisagion}, this paper addresses the various criteria used to create two new genre codes, "Varia" (Va) and "Holy Week Varia" (VaHW). Although these classifiers provide less specificity than other possible options, they avoid over-interpretation, are easy-to-use by novice indexers, and usefully differentiate the unique chants of Holy Week from other chant miscellany.},

But a close look to the manuscript reveals a great number of performance-related modifications of both the musical and textual content. These transformations have mostly been major ones, like deletions of whole measures or text passages, and insertions of new pages. On the basis of the BMBF-sponsored project "Freisch{\"u}tz Digital" (Digital edition of the \textit{Freisch{\"u}tz}, hereafter "FreiDi"), this paper tries to develop a way to describe the textual and physical modifications of the manuscript not only verbally but in a semantic, i.e. logic, encoding, based on MEI. For this, the paper explores possible modifications of MEI elements, or the creation of new elements and attributes for the special problems. It will explore the usefulness of markup from other projects, most importantly the \textit{Beethoven Werkstatt} project with its genetic encodings.

It offers some basic information on Ottoman music, focusing on the scholarly transcription into staff notation of manuscript sources written in Hampartsum notation. We discuss the modelling of metadata according to FRBR and MEI, and the challenges involved in adapting the source material to schema that were developed with different musical concepts and practices as their model. We describe the workarounds, tools and procedures we developed to encode Ottoman music in a way that meets both visual and semantic demands, and reflects musical as well as philological aspects of the sources. These solutions are offered as a possible first step towards integrating non-Western musical repertoires and sources into the MEI schema.},

We focused on the solo piano scores of the "Apaches" subset of potential \textit{debussystes}, comparing them to a randomly selected control group of their peers. Due to the challenge of manually correcting these complex scores, we experimented with leaving the errors generated during the OMR process uncorrected in our MEI files, planning to correct them progressively in later stages of hypothesis testing. We then validated the error level and successfully analyzed nearly all of the scores for parallel 5ths and meter changes using customized MEI search programs. Even when taking the estimated error levels into account, a statistically significant difference was discovered between the Apaches and control groups. In addition to presenting these initial findings, our description of the methodological challenges of encoding and analyzing these complex scores might serve as a model for how to deploy a multi-hypothesis corpus study involving difficult scores over several, more manageable steps.},

So far, this problem has been approached through heuristics and grammars, which are not generalizable solutions. We borrowed the seq2seq model and the attention mechanism from machine translation to address this issue. Given its example-based learning, the model proposed is meant to apply to different notations provided there is enough training data. The model was tested on the PrIMuS dataset of common Western music notation incipits. Its performance was satisfactory for the vast majority of examples, flawlessly extracting the musical meaning of 85% of the incipits in the test set -- mapping correctly series of accidentals into key signatures, pairs of digits into time signatures, combinations of digits and rests into multi-measure rests, detecting implicit accidentals, etc.},

@inproceedings{Ricciardi_2020,
 abstract = {Despite the interdisciplinary nature of the Italian madrigal -- a genre in which poetry and music often stand on equal footing -- critical editions of this repertoire tend to focus primarily on the \textit{musical} text, devoting limited attention to the often-complex philological tradition of the poems set to music. Likewise, most critical editions are devoted to the works of a single composer -- as opposed to settings of the same poetry by multiple composers -- and thus offer a rather segmented perspective on the repertoire, which is not conducive to the study of musical traditions and to comparative analysis. This paper proposes a new model for critical editions of this repertoire, one in which musical \textit{and} poetic texts are devoted equal attention. To do so, we will provide an overview of a digital project that follows this model, namely the Tasso in Music Project (www.tassomusic.org), showing how it draws on both musical (Humdrum, MEI) and textual (TEI) encoding systems to render the interdisciplinary nature of its repertoire.},

The Verovio MEI engraver reflects the hierarchy and identifiers of these encodings into its generated SVG output, supporting presentation of digital scores as richly interactive Web applications. Typical MEI workflows initially involve scholarly or editorial activities to generate an encoding, followed by its subsequent publication and use. Further iterations may derive new encodings from precedents; but the suitability of MEI to interactive applications also offers more dynamic alternatives, in which the encoding provides a framework connecting data that is generated and consumed simultaneously in real-time. Exemplars include compositions which self-modify according to external contextual parameters, such as the current weather at time of performance, or which are assembled by user-imposed external semantics, such as a performer's explicit choices and implicit performative success at playing musical triggers within a composition. When captured, these external semantic signals (interlinked with the MEI structure) themselves encode the evolution of a dynamic score during a particular performance. They have value beyond the immediate performance context; when archived, they allow audiences to revisit and compare different performances.},

@inproceedings{Herold_2020,
 abstract = {For musicologists, the collation of multiple sources of the same work is a frequent task. By comparing different witnesses, they seek to identify variation, describe dependencies, and ultimately understand the genesis and transmission of (musical) works. Obviously, the need for such comparison is independent from the medium in which a musical work is manifested. In computing, comparing files for difference is a common task, and the well-known Unix utility \textit{diff} is almost 46 years old. However, \textit{diff}, like many other such tools, operates on plain text. While many music encoding formats based on plain text exist, formats used in the field of Digital Humanities are typically based on XML. There are dedicated algorithms for comparing XML as well, but they only focus on the syntax of XML, but not the semantic structures modelled into such standards as MEI. MEI seeks to describe musical structures, and the XML syntax is just a means to express those structures. A diff tool for music should focus on comparing musical structures, but not the specifics of their serialization into a file format. In \textit{Beethovens Werkstatt}, a 16-year project focussed on exploring the concepts and requirements of digital genetic editions of music, based on and arguing with examples from Ludwig van Beethoven, a case-bound diff tool for music was developed. The following paper discusses how that specific tool can be generalized, and which use cases such a tool may support.},

@inproceedings{NapolesLopez_2020,
 abstract = {High-quality annotations of harmonic analysis are scarce. Furthermore, the existing data usually follows different conventions for spelling scale degrees, inversions, and special chords (e.g., cadential six-four). There have been efforts for standardizing the notation of harmonic analysis annotations, however, these have not been very successful because: 1) there are few software tools able to parse such notations 2) as a consequence, researchers have not adopted the suggested notations and it is more frequent to find a different notation with every new dataset. We attempt to mitigate the limitations of existing notations through the definition of a new language for harmonic analysis, which we call \textit{harmalysis}. This language 1) provides a notation that adjusts as much as possible to the way in which researchers have annotated roman numerals in existing datasets, 2) formalizes the resulting notation into a consistent and extensible context-free grammar, 3) uses the context-free grammar to generate tools that are able to parse and validate annotations in the syntax of the language. We make the formal definition of the language, a context-free grammar described in the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), available as an open-source repository. Within the same repository, we make available tools for parsing annotations in the harmalysis language. The tools allow the users to extract high-level semantic information from their annotations (e.g., local key, root of the chord, inversion, added intervals, whether the chord is tonicizing another key or not, etc.) and to validate the correctness of a given annotation according to the grammar of the proposed language.},

@inproceedings{Desmond_2020,
 abstract = {This poster presents an NEH-funded project to develop a prototype editor for encoding mensural notation (PI: Karen Desmond, Brandeis University). It builds on the Measuring Polyphony project (measuringpolyphony.org), a website that presents digitisations of polyphonic motets copied in late medieval manuscripts in mensural notation. Coding of the editor prototype began in January 2020, and a workshop directly before the 2020 Music Encoding Conference evaluated the prototype in terms of its interface and design, accessibility, and interoperability, and advised on a plan for the project's full implementation. This poster includes links to videos that outline the main functionality of the prototype and a summary of the project goals, impact, and next stages of edevelopment.},
