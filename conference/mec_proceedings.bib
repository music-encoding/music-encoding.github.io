@inproceedings{Bohl_2016,
 abstract = {Tracing back theoretical discussion and writing about the nature of music, leads as far as classical antiquity. Pythagoras (of Samos) laid out the mathematical foundations of musical harmony -- and hence constituted the tradition of more than 2.500 years that we can look upon today. Ever since, knowledge on music and its theory has been accompanied by the knowledge about its history. No matter the century that you pick, the basic pythagorean derivation of musical harmony or some variant of the "legend of the hammer strokes" is omnipresent. This tradition produced a huge corpus of individual treatises that provide rules for composing  music. Different eras and genres called for different rules and not seldom, personal preference and self-display were motors to pen down a certain theory of music. Moreover, notorious treatises got transcribed, reproduced me-chanically or borrowed from and -- as consciousness of authorship and copyright had yet to prosper -- partly incorporated into other treatises, without referencing the original author. Beside the amount of pages to grasp in various languages, the above mentioned circumstances make it es-pecially hard for the uninitiated to know which rule to find where or even to fathom the multiple interrelations between these treatises},

@inproceedings{Diet_2016,
 abstract = {The RISM-OPAC (http://opac.rism.info) is a free online catalogue that provides access to the data of the RISM series A II (music manuscripts between 1600 and 1800). It has been developed by the Bavarian State Library in cooperation with RISM and the State Library of Berlin and was launched in June 2010. In March 2011, a new version of the RISM-OPAC has been released that includes a searching possibility in the music incipits of the RISM data. Most of the 850.000 data records (as of September 2013) contain one or several music incipits that describe the beginning of instrumental or vocal parts of the music manuscripts using the Plaine{\&}Easie code. This paper describes how the music incipits are encoded in Plaine{\&}Easie and how the searching for music incipits is done in the RISM-OPAC. Furthermore, the rendering of an incipit encoded in Plaine{\&}Easie in a graphical image will be covered. When a RISM-record is displayed the user will not see the Plaine{\&}Easie code but the corresponding graphical form using the common western music notation. Finally, the current developments for the next version of the RISM-OPAC will be explained that include among others an improved user interface for searching in the music incipits and the conversion of the data records of the RISM series A/II into RDF in order to publish them as linked open data.},

@inproceedings{Richts_2016,
 abstract = {The Music Encoding Initiative's (MEI) XML schema recommendation not only supports detailed encodings of music notation; it also accommodates comprehensive metadata in the file header. The attempt to utilize the header for cataloguing projects has proved the need to distinguish different levels of description: Some meta-data relate to the musical work in general, some only to a certain version, or to a specific musical source, for instance. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, which was developed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), was explicitly conceived to provide a concept for this distinction within bibliographic records in general. An effort has been made within the MEI community to implement the so-called FRBR Group 1 entities (work, expression, manifestation, and item) and relationships in the MEI header. The paper gives an introduction to the FRBR implementation in MEI and demonstrates how relatively com-plex source situations can be modeled with it. Some limitations and problems are discussed.},

The approach relates closely to the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and to psychological coding theories of perceptual organisation. A sketch of a model of musical learning based on this approach is given and it is shown how the model accounts in principle for differences between individuals in how pieces of music are understood. The approach is implemented in a greedy compression algorithm, called COSIATEC, which partitions a point-set into the covered sets of translational equivalence classes of maximal translatable patterns. The analyses generated by COSIATEC on five fugues by J. S. Bach are presented and discussed. These analyses demonstrate the potential of the approach for automatically discovering musical patterns of thematic and structural importance.},

 abstract = {\textit{Plaine and Easie Code} is being used as the format for encoding musical content in the RISM catalogue. In this paper we propose an attributed grammar that formally specifies it. The grammar specification is written using a EBNF notation and is accompanied by syntax diagrams and some examples that show how it parses a valid input. With the formalization of the \textit{Plaine and Easie Code}, it is easier to create translators to other formats, analyze possible extensions, and avoid syntactic misunderstandings in the encoding process. The proposed grammar has been successfully used to decode more than one million incipits from the RISM catalogue in an automatic way. In the near future, we are planning to propose some extensions to the PAEC code and specify translation semantic actions associated to the grammar productions in order to convert from PAEC to the MEI format.},

@inproceedings{Hild_2016,
 abstract = {This essay describes the development process and encoding scheme of mono:di, the MEI-based, music-notation software program of \textit{Corpus monodicum}. \textit{Corpus monodicum} is a scholarly edition of the Latin-texted, medieval monophonic repertories -- both sacred and secular -- that form the historical foundation of European music, but have thus far been under-represented in musicological scholarship. The editorial project is spon-sored by the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, as part of the Akademienprogramm der Union der deutschen Akademien der Wissenschaften; it is housed at the Institut f{\"u}r Musikforschung, Universit{\"a}t W{\"u}rzburg.
    Mono:di was developed in conjunction with the music typesetting firm notengrafik berlin in order to facilitate the production of \textit{Corpus monodicum}'s publications, which will include both a series of 25 printed volumes and a digital edition (CM digital). Mono:di offers the project's editors a means of creating digital transcriptions in a direct and efficient way. The software also allows for an unproblematic transfer of editorial material to the typesetters who produce the analogue editions. Moreover, mono:di allows the same encoded material to serve as the basis both for the printed volumes and for the digital edition. This paper examines the editorial practices that shaped mono:di's development and the specific adaptations that were made to the MEI neumes module in mono:di's encoding scheme.},

@inproceedings{Pugin_2016,
 abstract = {The Music Encoding Initiative defines the specifications of encoding music in XML format. While MEI is extremely powerful and promising, very few tools exist for rendering it directly into graphical music notation. Most of the solutions currently used require an intermediate step to convert it into a format that can then be processed by one existing music typesetter. This approach has the disadvantage of being complex, often slow, and needing to rely on other tools for the task, whilst losing some of MEI's features in the conversion process. Verovio is an attempt to solve this issue: it is a portable, small and fast library that is capable of interpreting MEI directly to SVG music output, without intermediate steps. Its development focuses on compatibility with the MEI specification and also on making portable code that is easily employed in different environments, from rendering of small-scale incipit to rendering long multi-page scores. The paper presents some use-case scenarios for the Verovio library.},

@inproceedings{Bemman_2016,
 abstract = {In recent years, a significant body of research has focused on developing algorithms for computing analyses of musical works automatically from encodings of these works' surfaces [3,4,7,10,11]. The quality of the output of such analysis algorithms is typically evaluated by comparing it with a "ground truth" analysis of the same music produced by a human expert (see, in particular, [5]).

 In this paper, we explore the problem of generating an encoding of the musical surface of a work automatically from a systematic encoding of an analysis. The ability to do this depends on one having an effective (i.e., computable), correct and complete description of some aspect of the structure of the music. Generating the surface structure of a piece from an analysis in this manner serves as a proof of the analysis' correctness, effectiveness and completeness.

 We present a reductive analysis of \textit{Sheer Pluck} (1984), a twelve-tone composition for guitar by Milton Babbitt (1916--2011). This analysis focuses on the all-partition array structure on which the piece is based. Having presented this analysis, we formalize some constraints on the structure of the piece and explore some computational difficulties in automating the generation of the all-partition array structure},

In this method, a comment list is compiled, consisting of variant readings and editorial emendations. This list is maintained by inserting the comments into a document as the changes are made. Since the comments are not input sequentially, with regard to position, but in arbitrary order, this list must be sorted by copy/pasting the rows into place -- an error-prone and time-consuming process. Scholars who produce critical editions typically use off -the-shelf music notation software such as Sibelius or Finale. It was hypothesized that it would be possible to develop a Sibelius plug-in, written in Manuscript 6, that would improve the critical editing work fl ow, but it was found that the capabilities of this scripting language were insufficient. Instead, a 3-part system was designed and built, consisting of a Sibelius plug-in, a cross-platform application, called CriticalEd, and a REST-based solution, which handles data storage/retrieval. A prototype has been tested at the Danish Centre for Music Publication, and the results suggest that the system could greatly improve the efficiency of the critical editing work flow.},

 abstract = {The \textit{Digital Mozart Edition} (DME) has as its goal the digital presentation of documents and texts related to Mozart's life and oeuvre. The most challenging project within the DME is the digital edition of Mozart's music which is currently being developed. It will eventually make the complete compositional output of Mozart available to the public in critical, MEI based editions. The DME already hosts the \textit{NMA Online}, the representation in digital images of the \textit{Neue Mozart Ausgabe} (NMA) print edition, originally published between 1954 and 2007. While on the one hand, the DME seeks to transform the authoritative musical text of the NMA into digital format, the DME also intends to broaden the philological concept by the publication of new and alternative editions based on individual sources. At the present state of the project, several challenges have been identified, some connected to the publication history and the availability of sources used by the NMA. Others are related to the representation of the \textit{Kritische Berichte} of the NMA within the DME. The paper reports on the development of the conceptual as well as practical model of the DME music edition.},

Repurposing data collected over the last three decades in Scribe music encoding software required a bespoke MEI module, which we have called NeoScribe. The Scribe project has benefited from the long-term investigation and implementation of methods for the efficient encoding of late medieval music notation. With Scribe, users are able to represent every meaningful scribal mark on the written page, something that is not currently possible in the current MEI Chant and Mensural modules. In converting Scribe data to a MEI-compliant XML, we recognised the need to retain Scribe's nuance-rich encoding of medieval musical notation. For zero dataloss, new elements and data types were added to MEI for encoding late medieval chant and mensural notation. We demonstrate some of NeoScribe's enhanced features for encoding 14th-century repertoires. We conclude by discussing some of the benefits of revising the MEI Chant and Mensural modules for projects investigating music from before c.1500.},

 abstract = {This paper stems from the project of redevelopment of the \textit{Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum} (TML), the online searchable archive of early music treatises in Latin. Over 25 years after the project's inception, work is in progress to enrich the large corpus of plain-text files by encoding them with TEI, to improve the resource's fruition and the discoverability of the text. Over that background, a quite more difficult challenge emerges: to make also discoverable the large quantity of notated examples found interleaved with the verbal text of the treatises. It was not in the original intent to make music notation systematically searchable, but attempts were made to capture some facets of mensura notation through a code specifically designed for the project. The aim of this paper is both to discuss these earlier encoding attempts, with their shortcomings, and to propose our customization of MEI as a possible starting point to expand the current specifications. This is proving useful in the present state of the project: more work will be necessary to take care of other mensural features and flavors, and of course of chant and non-mensural notations, but MEI is proving apt to the job. The TML provides an ideal benchmark for developing a more specialized model of markup that will be useful for many other scholarly purposes.

The notation, named the Kassel-Wolfenb{\"u}ttel Tablature System (KWTS) by Marc Lewon, combines a quasi- mensural notation, which closely resembles the upper voice of organ tablature, and an alphabetic notation, parallel to organ tablature. Because of its connections to both tablature and mensural notations, in order to encode KWTS, one must combine the encoding systems for both tablature and mensural notation. In this paper, I examine some of the problems inherent in encoding KWTS; suggest possible solutions; and define a musicological application for the project. As the earliest lute-specific notation, KWTS contains valuable information on the changing lute performance practices of the mid-fifteenth century, despite the sources' brevity. Developing an encoding system for this notation will enable further exploration of fifteenth-century lute repertoire, including that prior to lute-specific notation.},

Although many of the chants follow the standard, expected forms, some items are difficult to classify. For example, certain melodies do not conform to the standard modes and some chants are unique in their usage for a particular day or service within the liturgical year. Although it is easy to create new classification tags, the prudent database manager exercises caution, as the modern need to categorize does not always conform to medieval custom. By focusing on chants from Holy Week including the \textit{Exsultet}, \textit{Improperia} and \textit{Trisagion}, this paper addresses the various criteria used to create two new genre codes, "Varia" (Va) and "Holy Week Varia" (VaHW). Although these classifiers provide less specificity than other possible options, they avoid over-interpretation, are easy-to-use by novice indexers, and usefully differentiate the unique chants of Holy Week from other chant miscellany.},

But a close look to the manuscript reveals a great number of performance-related modifications of both the musical and textual content. These transformations have mostly been major ones, like deletions of whole measures or text passages, and insertions of new pages. On the basis of the BMBF-sponsored project "Freisch{\"u}tz Digital" (Digital edition of the \textit{Freisch{\"u}tz}, hereafter "FreiDi"), this paper tries to develop a way to describe the textual and physical modifications of the manuscript not only verbally but in a semantic, i.e. logic, encoding, based on MEI. For this, the paper explores possible modifications of MEI elements, or the creation of new elements and attributes for the special problems. It will explore the usefulness of markup from other projects, most importantly the \textit{Beethoven Werkstatt} project with its genetic encodings.

It offers some basic information on Ottoman music, focusing on the scholarly transcription into staff notation of manuscript sources written in Hampartsum notation. We discuss the modelling of metadata according to FRBR and MEI, and the challenges involved in adapting the source material to schema that were developed with different musical concepts and practices as their model. We describe the workarounds, tools and procedures we developed to encode Ottoman music in a way that meets both visual and semantic demands, and reflects musical as well as philological aspects of the sources. These solutions are offered as a possible first step towards integrating non-Western musical repertoires and sources into the MEI schema.},

We focused on the solo piano scores of the "Apaches" subset of potential \textit{debussystes}, comparing them to a randomly selected control group of their peers. Due to the challenge of manually correcting these complex scores, we experimented with leaving the errors generated during the OMR process uncorrected in our MEI files, planning to correct them progressively in later stages of hypothesis testing. We then validated the error level and successfully analyzed nearly all of the scores for parallel 5ths and meter changes using customized MEI search programs. Even when taking the estimated error levels into account, a statistically significant difference was discovered between the Apaches and control groups. In addition to presenting these initial findings, our description of the methodological challenges of encoding and analyzing these complex scores might serve as a model for how to deploy a multi-hypothesis corpus study involving difficult scores over several, more manageable steps.},

So far, this problem has been approached through heuristics and grammars, which are not generalizable solutions. We borrowed the seq2seq model and the attention mechanism from machine translation to address this issue. Given its example-based learning, the model proposed is meant to apply to different notations provided there is enough training data. The model was tested on the PrIMuS dataset of common Western music notation incipits. Its performance was satisfactory for the vast majority of examples, flawlessly extracting the musical meaning of 85% of the incipits in the test set -- mapping correctly series of accidentals into key signatures, pairs of digits into time signatures, combinations of digits and rests into multi-measure rests, detecting implicit accidentals, etc.},

@inproceedings{Ricciardi_2020,
 abstract = {Despite the interdisciplinary nature of the Italian madrigal -- a genre in which poetry and music often stand on equal footing -- critical editions of this repertoire tend to focus primarily on the \textit{musical} text, devoting limited attention to the often-complex philological tradition of the poems set to music. Likewise, most critical editions are devoted to the works of a single composer -- as opposed to settings of the same poetry by multiple composers -- and thus offer a rather segmented perspective on the repertoire, which is not conducive to the study of musical traditions and to comparative analysis. This paper proposes a new model for critical editions of this repertoire, one in which musical \textit{and} poetic texts are devoted equal attention. To do so, we will provide an overview of a digital project that follows this model, namely the Tasso in Music Project (www.tassomusic.org), showing how it draws on both musical (Humdrum, MEI) and textual (TEI) encoding systems to render the interdisciplinary nature of its repertoire.},

The Verovio MEI engraver reflects the hierarchy and identifiers of these encodings into its generated SVG output, supporting presentation of digital scores as richly interactive Web applications. Typical MEI workflows initially involve scholarly or editorial activities to generate an encoding, followed by its subsequent publication and use. Further iterations may derive new encodings from precedents; but the suitability of MEI to interactive applications also offers more dynamic alternatives, in which the encoding provides a framework connecting data that is generated and consumed simultaneously in real-time. Exemplars include compositions which self-modify according to external contextual parameters, such as the current weather at time of performance, or which are assembled by user-imposed external semantics, such as a performer's explicit choices and implicit performative success at playing musical triggers within a composition. When captured, these external semantic signals (interlinked with the MEI structure) themselves encode the evolution of a dynamic score during a particular performance. They have value beyond the immediate performance context; when archived, they allow audiences to revisit and compare different performances.},

@inproceedings{Herold_2020,
 abstract = {For musicologists, the collation of multiple sources of the same work is a frequent task. By comparing different witnesses, they seek to identify variation, describe dependencies, and ultimately understand the genesis and transmission of (musical) works. Obviously, the need for such comparison is independent from the medium in which a musical work is manifested. In computing, comparing files for difference is a common task, and the well-known Unix utility \textit{diff} is almost 46 years old. However, \textit{diff}, like many other such tools, operates on plain text. While many music encoding formats based on plain text exist, formats used in the field of Digital Humanities are typically based on XML. There are dedicated algorithms for comparing XML as well, but they only focus on the syntax of XML, but not the semantic structures modelled into such standards as MEI. MEI seeks to describe musical structures, and the XML syntax is just a means to express those structures. A diff tool for music should focus on comparing musical structures, but not the specifics of their serialization into a file format. In \textit{Beethovens Werkstatt}, a 16-year project focussed on exploring the concepts and requirements of digital genetic editions of music, based on and arguing with examples from Ludwig van Beethoven, a case-bound diff tool for music was developed. The following paper discusses how that specific tool can be generalized, and which use cases such a tool may support.},

 abstract = {High-quality annotations of harmonic analysis are scarce. Furthermore, the existing data usually follows different conventions for spelling scale degrees, inversions, and special chords (e.g., cadential six-four). There have been efforts for standardizing the notation of harmonic analysis annotations, however, these have not been very successful because: 1) there are few software tools able to parse such notations 2) as a consequence, researchers have not adopted the suggested notations and it is more frequent to find a different notation with every new dataset. We attempt to mitigate the limitations of existing notations through the definition of a new language for harmonic analysis, which we call \textit{harmalysis}. This language 1) provides a notation that adjusts as much as possible to the way in which researchers have annotated roman numerals in existing datasets, 2) formalizes the resulting notation into a consistent and extensible context-free grammar, 3) uses the context-free grammar to generate tools that are able to parse and validate annotations in the syntax of the language. We make the formal definition of the language, a context-free grammar described in the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), available as an open-source repository. Within the same repository, we make available tools for parsing annotations in the harmalysis language. The tools allow the users to extract high-level semantic information from their annotations (e.g., local key, root of the chord, inversion, added intervals, whether the chord is tonicizing another key or not, etc.) and to validate the correctness of a given annotation according to the grammar of the proposed language.},

@inproceedings{Torrente-LLorens_2022,
 abstract = {Musicology is a small discipline within the wide spectrum of human knowledge, yet it is already divided into various branches, each with its own societies, conferences, journals, jargons, degrees, prejudices, $\ldots$, and jobs. Although they share their object of investigation -- ``the art of music as a physical, psychological, aesthetic, and cultural phenomenon'' --, these branches very often ignore one another. Research in musicology is mostly a solitary task, as investigations, papers, and publications are commonly signed by single authors, in contrast with STEM disciplines where teamwork is the rule. This is in part the result of tradition -- the ``Musicological Toolbox'' -- but also the aftermath of the job market and financing programs.

Large funding schemes such as the European Research Council (ERC) grants are becoming a major disruptive factor in many disciplines in the humanities, including musicology. Scholars in all fields now have the opportunity to build research teams, and most of their members receive their salaries to exclusively work on the project. In other words, we are starting to build what could be called a Musicology Lab, learning along the way how teamwork is reshaping and transforming the Musicological Toolbox, the look and feel of our discipline, the way we work as well as the way we publish and disseminate our results.

This paper presents some of the key features of the ERC Didone project, one of its principal tasks being to create a digitally encoded corpus of some 3,000 arias in MusicXML format from about 180 musical settings of a small number of opera librettos by Pietro Metastasio. It focuses on some of the project's research tasks, emphasizing how the skills of a team of eighteen scholars with very different expertise -- historical musicology, music theory and analysis, cultural history, librettology, archival research, music performance, music engraving, MIR, computer science, and statistical modeling -- combine to explore the potential answer(s) to the main research question of the project: How are emotions expressed through music?},

 abstract = {This paper presents the recent implementation of encoded music notation in two open access platforms of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) devoted to traditional music and polyphony, respectively: Fondo de M{\'u}sica Tradicional IMF-CSIC (FMT)1 and Books of Hispanic Polyphony IMF-CSIC (BHP)2. Even though, at first, both repertories seem unconnected, they have many textual/literary and musical points in common -- such as the presence/survival of old 15th--17th century texts and/or melodies of polyphonic romances (ballads) in the 20th century oral tradition --; future technological developments will facilitate further connections beyond the ones already found through search by text incipits and numeric melodic incipit connecting both platforms. The presentation will have two parts devoted to FMT (with more than 20.000 images of melodies in open access, it is the largest online archive of folklore in the Hispanic world; it is used also for OMR research) and BHP (a reference online catalogue for polyphonic choir books in Spain and books with Hispanic polyphony elsewhere). After a brief explanation about the origin and scope of the repertories covered in each platform, a few examples of encoded transcriptions of a melody, of an incipit in mensural notation, and of a polyphonic work (in MusicXML, **mens, and **kern; MEI can be used, too) rendered through Verovio will illustrate the potential development of FMT and BHP. Both websites constitute leading educational and musicological resources of the very rich Spanish music heritage, inviting national and international collaboration (crowdsourcing) to expand the contents of both platforms and to develop their digital technology.},

@inproceedings{Goebl_2022,
 abstract = {Though MEI is widely used in music informatics and digital musicology research, the relative lack of authoring software and the specialised nature of its community have limited the availability of high-quality MEI encodings. Translating to MEI from other encoding formats, or generating MEI via optical music recognition processes, is thus a typical component of many MEI-project workflows. However, automated translations rarely achieve results of sufficient quality, a problem well-known in the community and documented in the literature. Final correction and validation by hand is therefore a common requirement. In this paper, we present meifriend, an extension to the Atom text editor, which aims to relieve the degree of manual labour required in this process. The tool facilitates most common MEI editing tasks including the insertion and manipulation of MEI elements, makes the encoded score visible and interactively accessible to the user, and provides quality-of-life conveniences including keyboard shortcuts for editing functions as well as intelligent navigation of the MEI hierarchy. We detail the tool's implementation, describe its functionalities, and evaluate its responsiveness during the editing process, even when editing very large MEI files.},

 abstract = {Digital symbolic music scores offer many benefits compared to paper-based scores, such as a flexible dynamic layout that allows adjustments of size and style, intelligent navigation features, automatic page-turning, on-the-fly modifications of the score including transposition into a different key, and rule-based annotations that can save hours of manual work by automatically highlighting relevant aspects in the score. However, most musicians still rely on paper because they don't have access to a digital version of their sheet music, or their digital solution does not provide a satisfying experience. To bring digital scores to millions of musicians, we at Enote are building a mobile application that offers a comprehensive digital library of sheet music. These scores are obtained by a large-scale Optical Music Recognition process, combined with metadata collection and curation. Our material is stored in the MEI format and we rely on Verovio as a central component of our app to present scores and parts dynamically on mobile devices. This combination of the expressiveness of MEI with the beautiful engraving of Verovio allows us to create a flexible, mobile solution that we believe to be a powerful and true alternative to paper scores with practical features like smart annotations or instant transpositions. We also invest heavily into the open-source development of Verovio to make it the gold standard for rendering beautiful digital sheet music.},

These linear narratives are supported by audio examples, along with dynamic links that take the reader into a fully-interactive exploration of the occurrence of motifs across the opera. The reader's journey is supported with recorded music and scores, as well as novel visualisations of the orchestration and the timeline of the opera. The app is designed to operate over standards-based web documents published online, with extension and reuse in mind.

The adoption of MEI as the underlying format for the digital editions of the musical texts presented us with the challenge of designing an editing workflow that allowed us to critically edit the texts in a user-friendly software like Finale. In this article, we illustrate how the critical editions are transposed to MEI documents using an ad hoc tool developed within the project, and how they are visualized in the web application. Finally, we discuss the critical aspects of the workflow and possible next steps for our digital critical edition in relation to the state of the art of music encoding.},

@inproceedings{Kepper_2022,
 abstract = {Traditional music philology aims at establishing an edited text, which is supposed to stage a clearly identified and well-reasoned version of a musical work. Such a text will always depend on sources used for its preparation and decisions taken by the editor(s). However, the intention is to deliver a product -- a static text, which resembles a specific combination of the transmitted sources of the work in question. In Genetic Editing, the focus lies elsewhere: Instead of justifying a specific product version, the intention is to trace the creative processes involved in the composition of that work. Obviously, those processes are only accessible through transmitted documents as well, but those documents do not need to contain full texts, nor are they only relevant when the composition has already matured enough to more or less reflect the final work.

The Beethovens Werkstatt project is one of the first endeavors to explore the applicability of Genetic Editing to music. Several years ago, a presentation at MEC 2015 in Florence introduced the first findings of the project and illustrated the then novel approaches of encoding genetic processes in MEI [2]. The discussions of the conceptual model proposed there eventually led to the introduction of several new elements into MEI. Since then, not only MEI has evolved, but also the project. The paper at hand reflects on data model considerations for the project's current module.},

In this paper, the concept of metadata in the context of MEI is first examined, before two examples are used to show that metadata are more than just rudimentary descriptions. These examples are also intended to illustrate the extent to which metadata are encoded in the field of music philology and thus represent an attempt to create a little more awareness for the work of the Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group of MEI.

The examples deal on the one hand with the encoding of performance resources and on the other hand with watermarks. In both cases, the possibilities of metadata encoding with MEI version 4 are exhausted and it is discussed which steps are useful and necessary to create an even deeper, machine-readable structure so that these sub-fields of the MEI metadata can also be used for larger scientific purposes such as analyses.},

@inproceedings{Richts-Matthaei_2022a,
 abstract = {Library forms of cataloging may differ greatly from the cataloging requirements of musicological research projects: They are often not detailed enough and do not take a close enough look at aspects of content relevant to research, such as handwritten entries in materials, etc. Library catalog entries of individual documents stand on their own for historical reasons, but usually do not reflect relationships to other surviving materials. This observation was the starting point for the Detmold Court Theatre Project, a six-year research project (September 2014 -- January 2021) that looked at the interconnectedness of different surviving materials of a 19th century theatre company that existed from 1825 to 1875. This project dealt with a very detailed form of inventory indexing in order to hand over and make accessible the formerly related materials in their entirety. This form of indexing was called `contextual deep indexing'. This special form of indexing took into account not only the pure performance materials but also the surviving theatre files, such as fee books, revenue and expense documents, stock lists, director's books, role and costume books, etc. All information was recorded based on autopsy (in the case of musical records on the basis of already existing RISM records from the 1980s). It was the first attempt to carry out such a form of indexing on the basis of the MEI and TEI encoding standards for a large repertory. For this purpose, a data model was needed that focuses on the linking of MEI and TEI data and enables the linking of different surviving library holdings, with a focus on a FRBR-based indexing of performance materials and associated performers as well as the structure of the theatre. Using a custom ODD-based schema, separate records were created for all works, expressions, and manifestations (in this case preserving the unity of materials kept under a common signature) and given unique identifiers so that they can now all be referenced individually.

The paper summarizes the results of this pilot project. It addresses the particularities and requirements of an inventory development that does not focus on individual objects, but on the relationship between different objects (and subjects). It presents a document-oriented (not object-oriented) data model that uses library materials to revive an entire network of a long-gone organization.},

This position paper gives the background, motivation, and proposed approach of research currently being undertaken within the Beethoven in the House project. This will include a study of Steiner editions of Beethoven's 7th and 8th Symphonies and Wellingtons Sieg, making a detailed comparison between arrangements, systematically identifying a core common to multiple versions, and asking if this reflects the stated values of the publisher. A second survey will look for patterns across a larger sample of lesser-known and poorly catalogued scores, collating emergent indicators of arrangers' motivations within a narrative of the domestic market -- the music industry of its day. Both studies will innovate digital methods which characterise arrangements as music encodings, including `sparse' approaches to notation and annotation.},

 abstract = {NFDI4Culture is the consortium for research data on material and immaterial cultural heritage and offers a user-centered and research-led infrastructure. By focusing on the digital capture as well as data-based research of cultural assets, NFDI4Culture brings together different disciplines in their research interests but also in terms of their infrastructure needs. The consortium has been funded since October 2020 for an initial period of 5 years. Paderborn University is connected to NFDI4Culture via the Center for Music, Edition, Media (Zen-MEM), which bundles activities in the fields of digital musicology, music and film informatics, media science, media technologies, and in several areas of computer science with a special focus on Digital Music Edition and Digital Musicology. With its many projects, ZenMEM contributes a lot to the further development of MEI.

MEI will therefore also have a special place in NFDI4Culture. In addition to general community aspects and enhancements of the format, activities will focus on the development of best practice recommendations and training materials, the further development of MEI-related tools, such as MerMEId and the MEIGarage, and concepts for data quality in MEI, but also on the improvement of standard data for musical works. The poster will show the organizational structure of NFDI4Culture and its representation at Paderborn University, its interaction and networking with national and international infrastructures, combined with several examples where MEI is involved.},

@inproceedings{Hentschel_2022,
 abstract = {Chord-based harmony is an important aspect of many types of Western music, across genres, regions, and historical eras. However, the consistent representation and comparison of harmony across a wide range of styles (e.g., classical music, Jazz, Rock, or Pop) is a challenging task. Moreover, even within a single musical style, multiple theories of harmony exist, each relying on its own (possibly implicit) assumptions and leading to harmonic analyses with a distinct focus (e.g., on the root of a chord vs. its bass note) or representation (e.g., spelled vs. enharmonic pitch classes). Cross-stylistic and cross-theory comparisons are therefore even more difficult, particularly in a large-scale computational setting that requires a common overarching representation. To address these problems, we propose a model which allows for the representation of chords at multiple levels of abstraction: from chord realizations on the score level (if available), to pitch-class collections (including a potential application of different equivalences, such as enharmonic or octave equivalence), to pitch- and chord-level functions and higher-order abstractions. Importantly, our proposed model is also well-defined for theories which do not specify information at each level of abstraction (e.g., some theories make no claims about harmonic function), representing only those harmonic properties that are explicitly included and inducing others where possible (e.g., deriving scale degrees from root and key information). Our model thus represents an important step towards a unified representation of harmony and its various applications.},

@inproceedings{Lind_2022,
 abstract = {Musical scores are frequently annotated with harmonic information, but widely used text-based methods rely on a limited number of visual channels. Though glyph-based methods exploit more channels, existing systems often violate perceptual design principles when employing color and rarely capture the frequency of chordal changes or their harmonic function. In this work, we introduce a new design idiom for augmenting sheet music through chordal glyphs embedded directly within musical staves. Harmonic concepts, weighted by saliency and categorized by data type, are mapped to visual channels ranked by discriminability. Preattentive processing is leveraged to support various user tasks, alongside redundant encodings of foundational harmonic elements to improve overall perceptual effectiveness. Key names and chord roots are displayed using parallel hue-based 12-step categorical colormaps. We then distill several design implications inherent in assigning colors to musical pitches regarding perceptual and linguistic effectiveness. Following this discussion, we outline open research directions.},

@inproceedings{Matuszewska_2022,
 abstract = {The field of musicology is constantly being enriched with digital, searchable music data. This trend opens new research possibilities; conversely, it requires new abilities to work with numerous data sets efficiently. Digital tools facilitate searching large music corpora and serve music analysis well. Nevertheless, there is still a potential to better harmonize research perspectives from musicology and computer science to make computational analysis outcomes more explicit, comprehensible, and flexible.

The aim of this paper is to present new ways of handling, displaying, and considering musicological data. Music information from fugues BWV 846--851 composed by J.S. Bach, retrieved with Humdrum Tools and the Music Processing Suite (MPS) software, was processed and translated into a relational database. The visual display of the retrieved information was accomplished with dashboards using the data visualization software Tableau Public. The possibility of comparing each fugue's voices makes it easier to comprehend the knowledge hidden behind music data. Additional options enable further visual exploration of the analyses and ensure conditions for abduction under assumptions of diagrammatic reasoning as proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce.},

@inproceedings{Bohl_2022,
 abstract = {In the past twenty years, the technical setup of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) data framework has been adjusted several times. Each of those transitions was motivated by the wish to improve the ways in which MEI could be integrated with other formats, to simplify the maintenance of MEI, and to encourage more people to actively contribute to the development of MEI. Some of those objectives are contradictory, and accordingly, there is no single right answer for all times about the best possible technical setup for MEI. The main purpose of this poster is to give a historical overview of the technical setups that MEI has gone through in the 20 or so years of its existence, and to illustrate the current workflows. Ideally, this empowers wider parts of the community to contribute to the continued development of both the MEI specification and documentation. Eventually, it will explain the steps necessary to set up a local working environment to participate in these developments.},

In this poster a synoptic overview concerning the historical development of notational types used for Greek chants is given. This is followed by a record of various fonts and software for Byzantine neumes created since 1989. The goal of the poster is to present a new font for psaltic notations of the first and second Christian millennium, displaying the great variety of signs, neume families and neume combinations which are encountered in musical manuscripts and theoretical treatises of the Psaltic Art. These by far exceed the Byzantine neumes found today in the unicode system.

The future development of suitable software can facilitate interdisciplinary studies with other traditions and contribute to the communication between musicologists and musicians belonging to different areas of expertise.},

@inproceedings{Zwissler_2022,
 abstract = {A perspective on the specific issues of music encoding dealing with Electronic Music is presented. In many cases the works to be discussed exist in a fixed media format and hence no prescriptive score is necessary to facilitate a `valid' performance. While there are a number of descriptive scores for pieces of Electronic Music, these are to be treated differently, as they are purely aimed at analysis and therefore contain a certain information bias. Data that is more comparable to instrumental scores is contained in rare examples of so-called realization scores. It is argued that these realization scores can be identified as the main subject for encoding of Electronic Music works. For this we will discuss an example from one such score by Karlheinz Stockhausen. For his piece KONTAKTE, Stockhausen released a realization score that unfolds a very detailed documentation of all steps made within the studio production of that work, including the complex patching of studio devices and the specific transformation processes achieved by the use of tape machines. The paper presents an approach to formalize and encode all these steps within the framework of a semantic database. Using technology like the semantic web standard, Linked Data and the corresponding RDF/OWL framework, an Electronic Music production setup and its usage can be encoded, stored, and analyzed.},

@inproceedings{Desmond_2022,
 abstract = {This panel submission for the 2021 Music Encoding Conference brings together five short papers that focus on the making of computer-readable encodings of polyphony in the notational style -- mensural notation -- in which it was originally copied. Mensural notation was used in the medieval West to encode polyphony from the late thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The Measuring Polyphony (MP) Online Editor, funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant, is a software that enables non-technical users to make Humdrum and MEI encodings of mensural notation, and links these encodings to digital images of the manuscripts in which these compositions were first notated. Topics explored by the authors include: the processes of, and the goals informing, the linking of manuscript images to music encodings; choices and compromises made in the development process of the MP Editor in order to facilitate its rapid deployment; and the implications of capturing dual encodings -- a parts-based encoding that reflects the layout of the original source, and a score-based encoding. Having two encodings of the music data is useful for a variety of activities, including performance and analysis, but also within the editorial process, and for sharing data with other applications. The authors present two case studies that document the possibilities and potential in the interchange of music data between the MP Editor and other applications, specifically, MuRET, an optical music recognition (OMR) tool, and Humdrum analysis tools.},
