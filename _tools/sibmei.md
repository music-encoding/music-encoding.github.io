[SibMEI](https://github.com/music-encoding/sibmei/releases "Sibelius MEI Plugin") is an open source plug-in that makes it easy to export MEI from the [Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com) notation editor. In addition to facilitating the creation of MEI-formatted data without the burden of writing XML by hand, it also makes it possible to convert MusicXML files to MEI.

General installation instructions for Sibelius plug-ins can be found at [http://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?help=install](http://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?help=install "Install plug-in"). Once installed, an "Export to MEI" option will appear in the plug-in list in Sibelius.
