[mei-friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is a friendly, zero-install, browser-based MEI editor for music encodings, with schema-based autocompletion, GitHub integration, keyboard shortcuts, an easy-to-use look-up interface to the MEI Guidelines, and other goodies. The tool is intended as a ‘last mile’ editor aiming to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings generated via optical music recognition, or conversion from other formats. Further details are available from the tool's [GitHub page](https://mei-friend.github.io).
