[LibMEI](https://github.com/DDMAL/libmei) is a C++ library for reading and writing MEI files. It can be integrated into C++ software applications, but it can also be used in a wide range of environments through bindings. It ships with Python bindings using the Boost-Python framework. The source code and the documentation are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDMAL/libmei/ "GitHub") It is developed by the [Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Lab](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/) at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University, Montr√©al, Canada and is available under the MIT License.

LibMEI was created by Andrew Hankinson and Alastair Porter and seeks to define a common software library for interacting with files encoded in MEI. This is targeted at software developers who wish to integrate support for MEI into their software.
