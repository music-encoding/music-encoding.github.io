  <h2>Travel and Covid Regulations</h2>
  <p>At this time, no travel restrictions related to Covid impact travel to Denton or the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Tests are available for sale (self-tests) or in person at CVS and Walgreens pharmacies in town.
</p>

<h2>Getting to Denton</h2>
<p>International flights to this area arrive at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), between the cities of Fort Worth (west) and Dallas (east). Domestic and connecting flights also land at Dallas Love Field; Southwest Airlines serves Love Field exclusively. 
</p>
<p>Transportation options from the airports to Denton include Uber and Lyft, taxi service, rental cars, or by commuter train. Commuter rail service to Denton is not direct, and entails changing trains. Please plan on 2 to 3 hours to travel by rail from the airports to Denton. Trains arrive at the Downtown Denton Transit Center (604 E Hickory Street); visitors will need to arrange transportation from the station to their destination.
</p>
<p>For local trips, the Denton Country Transportation Authority offers a lower-cost, on-demand ride-share service called GoZone. More information can be found here: <a href="https://www.dcta.net/getting-around/gozone-demand">https://www.dcta.net/getting-around/gozone-demand</a>.

<p>Parking passes will be provided on conference days for those who will need to park on campus.</p>
