    <h1>Technology Plan for Virtual Conference</h1>

<p><i>This page will be updated in the days leading up to the event. Questions can be directed to music-encoding2020 at conftool.net.</i></p>

<p>The 2020 Music Encoding Conference will be run as a virtual event.</p>

<p>We will use Zoom and Slack for conference attendance. All presenters and registered attendees will receive details about joining via Zoom and Slack in advance of the event, and are welcome to join the Zoom meeting to follow the Keynotes, Paper “Slam” Sessions, and Town Hall meetings. Both the discussions following the Paper “Slam” Sessions, and the Interest Group meetings will be held via Slack.</p>

<p>In order to foster discussion and questions, presenters’ papers will be made available for attendees to read a few days prior to the event in a temporarily shared Google Drive folder. We encourage presenters and attendees alike to join the <a href="https://hcommons.org/groups/music-encoding-initiative/" target="_blank">Humanities Commons Music Encoding Initiative group</a>, where presenters’ papers will be deposited and accessible even after the event.</p>

<p>In addition to these platforms, we encourage community backchannel conversation – before, during, and after the conference – on Slack and Twitter (#MEC2020).</p>
