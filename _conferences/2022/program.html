      <summary>Music Encoding Basics and Background</summary>
      <p>90-minute tutorial. Simple hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Conveners: Maristella Feustle & MEI Pedagogy IG</p>
      <p> This session targets participants new to MEI, with a focus on concepts at the core of encoding music with MEI: an introduction to XML, an overview of encoding programs, the basic structure of music encoding, and rudimentary encoding. The session offers ample space to ask questions, and provides an entry point into the MEI community, and a smooth transition to engaging with the MEI Tutorial offered in the afternoon session.</p>

      <summary>Connecting Musics: Semantic Modelling as Challenge for Music Encoding</summary>
      <p>Half-day workshop. Simple hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Conveners: Richard Freedman, David Lewis, Stefan Münnich, Emilio Sanfilippo, David M. Weigl</p>
      <p>Semantic Web models, approaches, and technologies are playing an increasing role to manage, store, publish, share, link, and possibly integrate datasets. Examples are not missing for research and application in the Digital Humanities and music (e.g., DOREMUS, the Music Ontology, etc.). The understanding and use of Semantic Web methods, however, requires the mastery of complex notions spanning from computer science subjects like conceptual modeling and mathematical logic, to linguistics and philosophy, among others.</p>
      <p>The purpose of our proposed half-day workshop is thus twofold: first, to introduce MEC participants to Semantic Web methods with a specific target on music data management. This will include a hands-on session where participants will practice with the use of Semantic Web languages such as RDF and RDFS. Second, to dig into a specific modeling goal: The representation not only of musical works and events, but also the critical and analytic claims we make about them. In doing so, we will leverage on experience we have gained during research projects in musicology (such as TROMPA, Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass [CRIM], and others) which will be also briefly presented during the workshop.</p>

      <summary>Interactive OMR-assisted transcription of Mensural sources using MuRET</summary>
      <p>Half-day workshop. Simple hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Conveners: David Rizo, Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza, Martha Thomae, Juan C. Martínez-Sevilla</p>
      <p>Most of the musical heritage is only available as physical documents, given that the engraving process was carried out by handwriting or typesetting until the end of the 20th century. Their mere availability as scanned images does not enable tasks such as indexing or editing unless they are transcribed into a structured digital format. The transcription process from historical handwritten music manuscripts to a structured digital encoding has been traditionally performed following a fully manual workflow. At most, it has received some technological support in particular stages, like optical music recognition (OMR) of the source images, or transcription to modern notation with music edition applications.</p>

      <p>A new online tool called MUsic Recognition, Encoding, and Transcription (MuRET) has been recently developed, which covers all transcription phases, from the manuscript image to the encoded digital content. MuRET is designed as a machine-learning based research tool, allowing different processing approaches to be used, and producing both the expected transcribed contents in standard encodings and data for the study of the transcription process.</p>

      <p>The objective of this workshop is to showcase MuRET for an efficient transcription process and provide guidelines to take the most out of it. As a study case, we will consider a book of Mensural notation music, which will be completely transcribed during the workshop.</p>

      <summary>MEI Metadata and MerMEId (part 1)</summary>
      <p>Full-day workshop. Full hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Conveners: Margrethe Støkken Bue, Clemens Gubsch, Sophia Dörner, Dennis Ried, Peter Stadler</p>
      <p>The detailed and standardised collection of metadata in MEI is in many application scenarios a decisive criterion for making the collected research data searchable, reusable and archivable. Whether in music editions or work catalogues, basic and specific meta-information about composers, works and the researchers themselves is always collected and then made available online for users. In this joint workshop, participants will gain basic knowledge of metadata encoding in MEI and the use of the metadata editor MerMEId. Starting with a theoretical introduction to library concepts (implementation of FRBR and authority data) as well as an overview of the so-called MEI header, the participants will independently work on encodings in hands-on sessions and subsequently or in comparison learn how to use the MerMEId editor. </p>

      <summary>Encoding Musical Performances</summary>
      <p>Half-day workshop. Simple hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Convener: Axel Berndt</p>
      <p> The musical performance of a score is a domain rarely addressed in a reasonable level of detail by current digital music editions. A main reason for this may be a lack of suitable data formats that are capable of encoding more than ambiguous performance symbols or rather technical measurement series. The Music Performance Markup (MPM) format is a recent development that fills this gap. This half-day 3 hours workshop gives practical introduction to the format. The core software tool to create performance encodings is MPM Toolbox. Participants will familiarize themselves with it during the course of the workshop, will have the opportunity to experiment and create their own performance encodings, and give feedback that will motivate future development. </p>

      <summary>MEI Tutorial</summary>
      <p>Half-day workshop. Simple hybrid (Dalhousie + Online).<br/>
      Conveners: Johannes Kepper and perry Roland</p>
      <p>  This tutorial will provide an introduction to music encoding using the MEI Schema. It will give a brief introduction to the history of and rationale behind MEI, explain the basics of MEI markup, and provide guidance for how to learn other, more advanced aspects of MEI. </p>

      <summary>Sharing MEI: Common Semantics in Diverse Musics?</summary>
      <p>Panelists: Anna Plaksin, David Lewis, Nevin Şahin, Axel Berndt</p>
      <p>In this panel, we consider the role of MEI in providing common structures and meanings for heterogeneous musical practices and notations and, to a lesser extent, uses. Drawing on direct experience of working with particular cultural or historical material, we consider the robustness of the fundamental modelling of MEI, and its challenges and strengths. From a practical standpoint, we evaluate strategies for successfully working with MEI, whether through extension of the standard or linking to it from external data structures. We will engage the community with the problems of standardising musical semantics from a non-CMN perspective, and will start the process of developing recommendations for those who wish to engage with the standard to extend further our range of digitised and shareable musics.</p>

    9:00 - 10:00 Panel 2
    <details>
      <summary>Musicology and Music Philology. Can digitization revive an old connection?</summary>
      <p>Panelists: Johannes Kepper, Christine Siegert, Andreas Münzmay, Joy H. Calico, Richard Freedman</p>
      <p>At least in German-speaking countries, Music Philology was fundamental in establishing Musicology as a discipline. However, certainly since the second half of the 20th century, Musicology has explored many more research areas, and in many of these areas, research is rather disconnected from philological work. In many such fields, this is arguably valid, as the research isn't dealing with the music itself, but in other cases, the reason is probably that the outcomes of music philology are relatively inaccessible, and the ultimate correctness of a small number of notes doesn't challenge the musicological research questions in general.</p>
      <p>Digital editions may (hopefully) change that by generating FAIR research data. Instead of having to prepare the edition's contents for her own research, a musicologist may now just use the data offered by the edition and process according to her very own interest. At the same time, digital editions start to explore new approaches which go beyond traditional author- and work-centered editions. Some of these new concepts may also help to bridge the gap between music philology and musicology. So, when musicology over time went astray from music philology (or vice versa), the "digital turn" may help to bring them closer together again.</p>
      <p>The panel will discuss the potentials and requirements of these developments, and how this may affect the future relationship between Music Philology and wider Musicology.</p>
