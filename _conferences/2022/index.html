    <p>Music encoding is a critical component for fields and areas of study including computational or digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, and digital libraries. This event brings together enthusiasts from various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, music scholars, and students and provides an opportunity for learning and engaging with and from each other.</p>
