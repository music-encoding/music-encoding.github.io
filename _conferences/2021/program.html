    <h2>Program</h2>
    <p>All the scientific events of the conference have been planned to take place online between 15:00 and 21:00h (CEST) using a mixture of teleconferencing tools (<a href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a>), social virtual spaces (<a href="https://www.wonder.me">wonder.me</a>), and at least one (or more)  <a href="https://music-encoding.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> Townhall channel for asynchronous communication 
    <em>(<a href="https://www.wonder.me">wonder.me</a> just works on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers</em>).</p>
    <p>Note the following schedule may change slightly. Attendees will have access to a website containing the links to the online platforms and times updated in realtime.</p>

    <h3>Workshops</h3>
    <h4 id="workshops1">19 July 2021, 15:30 to 18:00 PM (CEST)</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Workshop 1: The Verovio ecosystem</dt>
        <dd>
            <p><a href="https://www.verovio.org/" target="_blank">Verovio</a> is an open-source library for engraving MEI scores. It can be used in a wide range of programming environments, including as a JavaScript toolkit in webpages. Verovio output is in SVG, an XML vector graphic format that makes it possible to easily interact with the encoding of the music score. It is used in dozens of digital musicology projects, with applications in digital critical editions, genetic editions, early music, audio alignment, online editing, music addressability, visualisation, performance, andeven composition via artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>The development of Verovio is conducted in close collaboration with the MEI community and is meant to be as generic as possible. Verovio itself is a C++ codebase hosted on GitHub and around which a rich development ecosystem has been put in place over the years. This ecosystem, which is continuously increased and improved, will be the focus of the workshop.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Workshop 2: LilyPond Workshop</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The course will first explain the syntax and basic functions of LilyPond using simple examples that will be implemented together with the participants. Building on this, workshop participants will be introduced to more complex examples from real projects (including splitting into multiple files, grouping settings into variables, working with (orchestral) scores and vocal excerpts, working in a team and with version management). The extension OLL with scholarLy even allows the integration of critical annotations on the spot, which is a big advantage compared to working with other notation programs (usually critical annotations have to be entered separately). An introduction with first application examples will be given in this module.</p>
            <p>The second part will be about the interfaces of LilyPond: Import from MusicXML, exportfrom MEI to LilyPond with MEILER, integration with LaTeX (glyphs and note examples in running text, larger note examples, critical report with scholarLy).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Workshop 3: Humdrum Workshop</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The workshop will start with a hands-on tutorial of the Humdrum data format, beginning with <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/humdrum/getting_started">fundamentals of encoding music notation</a> in Humdrum  using the <a href="https://verovio.humdrum.viewer">Verovio Humdrum Viewer</a> (VHV). Participants will learn how to import MusicXML/MEI files into VHV and convert them into Humdrum data, as well as exporting Humdrum data to MEI and PDF files.  A survey of <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/graphic/index.html">graphical editing capabilities</a> in VHV and equivalent direct textual changes to the Humdrum data will be compared.  Basic data processing methods such as adding lyrics and figured bass will be presented.  Encoding and working with mensural music as Humdrum data will be covered depending on the interests of the participants.</p>

            <p>Recent updates to VHV such as the <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/interface/toolbar">toolbar</a> will be highlighted, including <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/interface/toolbar/#buffer-save-toolbar">saving</a> and loading data into persistent buffers within the web browser, <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/interface/toolbar/#search-toolbar">searching musical content</a>, and <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/interface/toolbar/spreadsheet">linking VHV to Google Spreadsheets</a>, which increases efficiency for certain types of editing. Data processing and analysis using the <a href="https://doc.verovio.humdrum.org/filter">filter toolbar</a> will also be demonstrated.  Batch processing and analysis of Humdrum data on the command-line will be demonstrated and compared to VHV filters.</p>

            <p>Participants will learn how to export their digital scores as HTML files using the <a href="https://plugin.humdrum.org">Humdrum Notation Plugin</a> for online publishing.  Applications of Github for managing digital scores will be discussed, with example repositories being <a href="https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-370-chorales">Bach chorales</a> and <a href="https://github.com/craigsapp/beethoven-piano-sonatas">Beethoven</a> sonatas, and how such repositories can integrate into VHV’s built-in score menu or your own websites. The remainder of the workshop will demonstrate various web interfaces to Humdrum digitals scores, including the <a href="https://www.tassomusic.org">Tasso in Music Project</a> (<a href="https://github.com/TassoInMusicProject/tasso-scores">github</a>), the <a href="https://josquin.stanford.edu">Josquin Research Project</a> (<a href="https://github.com/josquin-research-project/jrp-scores">github</a>), <a href="https://humdrum.nifc.pl">Digital Editions of Chopin First Editions</a> at the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, and the <a href="https://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=poly">Polyrhythm project</a> (<a href="https://github.com/polyrhythm-project">github</a>).</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Workshop 4: Introduction to MEI</dt>
        <dd>This workshop is designed to introduce MEI to those interested in its history, current uses, and future development. No previous experience with MEI or XML is required; however, an understanding of music notation and other markup schemes, like HTML and TEI, will be helpful. For hands-on exercises, participants are encouraged to install the oXygen XML editor, which is available for free from www.oxygenxml.com for a limited trial period, or similar software. </dd>
        
        <dt>Workshop 5: ODD Tutorial</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This advanced technical workshop is aimed at members of the music encoding community who want to contribute to the development of the MEI schema. The goal is to broaden the insight into the technical dimensions of MEI, and to increase the pool of people working on its development. Familiarity with the MEI specification and some technical experience is expected (in particular, familiarity with XML and the concepts of elements, attributes, and values).</p>
            <p>During the workshop, we will walk through the Advanced MEI Online Tutorial “Understanding ODD –A tutorial on the internal structure of MEI.” This tutorial introduces the basic concepts of the ODD (One Document Does-it-all) language in which the schema of MEI is written. We will explain the basic principles of the ODD structures found in MEI through the individual examples covered in the tutorial.</p>
