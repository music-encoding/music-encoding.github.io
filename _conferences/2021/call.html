    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> On December 18, 2020, the MEI Board, the Organizing Committee and Program Committee of the Music Encoding Conference 2021 in Alicante have decided to postpone the event by two months from its original May date. The conference is now scheduled to take place from <strong>Monday 19 to Thursday 22 July 2021</strong> and is additionally being prepared to be held in <strong>hybrid mode</strong> to allow either physical or virtual participation.</p>

    <h2>Call for proposals</h2>

    <p>We are pleased to announce the call for papers, posters, panels, and workshops for the Music Encoding Conference 2021.</p>

    <p>As an important cross-disciplinary venue for all who are interested in the digital representation of music, the Music Encoding Conference is open to and brings together members from various encoding, analysis, and music research communities, including musicologists, theorists, librarians, technologists, music scholars, teachers, and students, and provides an opportunity for learning and engaging with and from each other.</p>

    <p>The MEC 2021 will take place <strong>19–22 July 2021</strong> at <a href="https://www.ua.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universidad de Alicante</a>, Spain. It is co-sponsored with the <a href="http://www.iseacv.gva.es/es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instituto Superior de Enseñanzas Artísticas de la Comunidad Valenciana</a>.</p>

    <p>Please pay attention to a revised submission process and schedule compared to previous years (see <a href="#submissions">submission section</a> below for details).</p>


    <h4>Background</h4>

    <p>Music encoding is a critical component for fields and areas of study including computational or digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, digital libraries, digital pedagogy, or the wider music industry.</p>

    <p>The Music Encoding Conference has emerged as the foremost international forum where researchers and practitioners from across these varied fields can meet and explore new developments in music encoding and its use. The Conference celebrates a multidisciplinary program, combining the latest advances from established music encodings, novel technical proposals and encoding extensions, and the presentation or evaluation of new practical applications of music encoding (e.g. in academic study, libraries, editions, pedagogy, commercial products).</p>

    <p>Pre-conference workshops provide an opportunity to quickly engage with best practice in the community. Newcomers are encouraged to submit to the main program with articulations of the potential for music encoding in their work, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches within this context.</p>

    <p>Following the formal program, an unconference session fosters collaboration in the community through the meeting of Interest Groups, and self-selected discussions on hot topics that emerge during the conference. For these meetings, there are various spaces generously provided by the hosting institution on July 22. Please be in touch with conference organizers if you need to reserve these spaces. For meetings on July 20 or 21 availability can be checked upon request.</p>

    <p>The program welcomes contributions from all those working on, or with, any music encoding. In addition, the Conference serves as a focus event for the Music Encoding Initiative community, with its annual community meeting scheduled the day following the main program. We in particular seek to broaden the scope of musical repertories considered, and to provide a welcoming, inclusive community for all who are interested in this work.</p>


    <h4>Topics</h4>

    <p>The conference welcomes contributions from all those who are developing or applying music encodings in their work and research. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>data structures for music encoding</li>
        <li>music encoding standardisation</li>
        <li>music encoding interoperability / universality</li>

        <li>conceptual encoding of relationships between multimodal music forms (e.g. symbolic music data, encoded text, facsimile images, audio)</li>
        <li>capture, interchange, and re-purposing of musical data and metadata</li>
        <li>ontologies, authority files, and linked data in music encoding and description</li>

    <h4>Additional information</h4>

    <p>As learned from the virtual MEC 2020, the imponderables of a global pandemic require to respond with flexibility to changing situations which have to be (re-)evaluated on a site-specific, short-term basis in the months leading up to the event. We hope that the decision to postpone the conference and to hold it in a hybrid format will contribute to the good and protection of everyone's health and of the Music Encoding Community. Any update will be communicated widely through the official channels (conference web page, mailing list, Twitter).</p>

    <p>Additional details regarding the hybrid conference format, registration, accommodation, etc. will be announced on the conference web page (<a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2021/">https://music-encoding.org/conference/2021/</a>).</p>
