    <h3>Before travelling</h3>
    <p>In addition to checking the travel restrictions in your country, you should make sure you've consulted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210703192353/https://www.spth.gob.es/">Spain Travel Health portal</a>. The local organizing team can assist you in getting a COVID-19 PCR test in Alicante. Note that tests usually take 1.5 business days to complete.</p>
    
    <h4>Basics for COVID-19 protection at the University of Alicante</h4>
    <p>Following the guidelines recommended by the relevant health and academic authorities, the University of Alicante (UA) has prepared an Action Protocol for the academic year 20/21 with all necessary preventive measures to face the current epidemiological situation safely.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, we recommend users not to enter the university premises if they have symptoms compatible with Covid-19, if there is a positive diagnosis, or they are in a period of preventive isolation. <strong>Once on campus, keeping a safety distance, use of hydrogels and disinfectants and use of masks in all university spaces is mandatory.</strong></p>
    
    <h5>Organisation of common spaces</h5>
    <p>Horizontal and vertical signs have been installed in all the on-campus buildings in order to delimit the areas and direction of traffic, as well as the points of hydroalcoholic gel supply.  Entrances and exits must be organised using the doors duly marked and maintaining the recommended interpersonal distance. Staying in corridors, passing areas and other spaces of common use will not be allowed in order to make access in the rooms easier maintaining the recommended interpersonal distance.</p>
    
    <p>The layout of the rooms has been restructured to guarantee recommended interpersonal distance of at least 1.5 metres and to comply with current regulations.  Everyone must go directly to the classroom and use the seats marked with a green sign a few minutes before any event starts.  Attendees must use the same seat throughout the whole day, whenever possible.  Spare time must be spent in open spaces, at libraries or common rooms enabled for this purpose.  Once events have ended, noone should not remain on university premises.</p>
    
    <p>In common spaces such as social clubs, sports area, UA Museum, etc., the specific regulations in force will be applied.</p>
    
    <p>All rooms will have dispensers with alcohol-based preparations available and all spaces are subject to daily cleaning and disinfection for areas of common use and more frequent contact surfaces.</p>
    
    <p>Also, with material shared among users, such as the keyboard or mouse, hand disinfection and teaching materials will be maintained with the use of alcohol-based preparations.  Additionally, other cleaning elements available in reception offices may be used.</p>
    
    <h5>Action in case of symptoms</h5>
    <p>In the event that symptoms compatible with COVID-19 occur during your stay on university premises, you should immediately inform an event organizer or the Medical Service, by calling at +34 965 90 95 95.</p>
    <p>The protocol has set up isolation rooms at different points on the campus where the person with compatible symptoms will be sent, always accompanied by technical or health personnel from the Medical Service from where they will receive appropriate assistance.</p>
    <p>The protocol responds to the Agreement of 19 June 2020, by the Regional Government, on prevention measures against COVID-19, modified by the Decision of 17 July 2020, of the Regional Health Public Health Minister, which gives powers to the Department of Innovation, Universities, Science and Digital Society, in coordination with the Department of Public Health, and the universities of the Valencia Regional Government, for the development of an action protocol for the beginning of the academic year, always respecting the university self-governing status.  The document prepared by the University of Alicante is an adaptation to the specificities of the facilities and teaching organisation of the University of Alicante centres, from the document prepared jointly by the five universities and the regional departments.  </p>
